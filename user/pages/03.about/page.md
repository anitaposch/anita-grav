# About Anita Posch
![Anita Posch](_anita-posch-500.jpg)

Anita Posch is a Change Agent and Freedom Tech advocate, a renowned Bitcoin educator, author, founder of the online academy [Crack the Orange](https://cracktheorange.com) as well as founder of [Bitcoin for Fairness](https://bffbtc.org), a non-profit initiative that has a strong focus on Bitcoin adoption in the Global South through education, knowledge sharing and capacity building on the ground. 

Anita's focus is on promoting Freedom Tech like Bitcoin and Nostr, which empower individuals and the civil society in achieving financial freedom, digital privacy, self-sovereignty and protection from governmental and corporate surveillance. 

Since 2020, Anita has tirelessly traveled to difficult political climates like Zimbabwe to foster local communities (activists and journalists) about how to use Bitcoin safely. In Zambia she supported an independent community driven entity that calls itself "Bitcoin Zambia" and conducts workshops and meetups in Lusaka and supports new initiatives like "Bitcoin Victoria Falls".

She has partnered with the [Human Rights Foundation](https://hrf.org) on many trainings at the Oslo Freedom Forum and at other events to teach the leaders of large grassroots organizations about best practices for Bitcoin use. Anita also regularly tests popular Bitcoin and Lightning applications in difficult environments with bad internet connectivity, and grades them, providing a valuable window into pain points for developers.

Anita has been sharing her experiences and learnings from her time in the Global South in many keynotes at conferences, interviews and podcasts to audiences in Western countries.

## Anita Posch's Bitcoin Story

Anita Posch tweeted about Bitcoin as early as in 2011, but dismissed it at that time, because she thought it's just another payment system like PayPal. In early 2017 she attended a talk highlighting Bitcoin and open blockchains and the positive impact they could have on society. She realized that a technology which is permissionless, censorship-resistant and inflation-proof could free anyone being disenfranchised by current financial power dynamics. Bitcoin is unstoppable money that can be used by anyone regardless of who they are. It's neutral, not controlled by any company or government, while at the same time being an internet protocol, financial rails built for the common good.

>Bitcoin might be our only tool to secure the human right to privacy and freedom of transaction. It’s a medium of liberation for billions of people and a defense mechanism for privacy in our ever more digital lives. – Anita Posch

Bitcoin is money from the people, for the people. Its mathematical rules can't be corrupted - neither by governments nor by billionaires. This guarantees a level of fairness which cannot be achieved in traditional human driven systems. It gives underprivileged individuals, such as people from developing nations, women, and oppressed minority groups the chance to participate globally in a free and private manner with each other. This freedom to exchange value, unleashing people's creativity and innovation, is what drives Anita Posch.
