Since 2020, Anita has tirelessly traveled to difficult political climates like in Zimbabwe or Ghana to support local communities, activists and journalists in learning about how to use Bitcoin safely.

## Anita Posch's Bitcoin Story

Anita Posch tweeted about Bitcoin as early as in 2011, but dismissed it at that time, because she thought it's just another payment system like PayPal. In early 2017 she attended a talk highlighting Bitcoin and open blockchains and the positive impact they could have on society. She immediately realized that a permissionless, censorship-resistant and inflation-proof money-technology could free anyone who's being disenfranchised by current financial power dynamics. Bitcoin is unstoppable money that can be used by anyone regardless of who they are. It's neutral, not controlled by any company or government, while at the same time being an internet protocol, financial rails built for the common good.

> "Bitcoin might be our only tool to secure the human right to privacy and freedom of transaction. It’s a medium of liberation for billions of people and a defense mechanism for privacy in our ever more digital lives." – Anita Posch

Bitcoin is money from the people, for the people. Its mathematical rules can't be corrupted - neither by governments nor by billionaires. This guarantees a level of fairness which cannot be achieved in traditional human driven systems. It gives underprivileged individuals, such as people from developing nations, women, and oppressed minority groups the chance to participate globally in a free and private manner with each other. This freedom to exchange value, unleashing people's creativity and innovation, is what drives Anita Posch.
