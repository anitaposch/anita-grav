# Can Africa Become Financially Sovereign? With Anita Posch

Anita Posch was a guest on The Transformation of Value podcast with Cody Ellingham, where she shared powerful insights from her years of experience working in Zimbabwe and across Sub-Saharan Africa.

In this eye-opening episode, Anita talks about the harsh realities of corruption, hyperinflation, and broken infrastructure-and how Bitcoin offers a unique path to financial sovereignty for those living under authoritarian regimes. From grassroots Bitcoin mining projects in Zimbabwe to circular economies in Zambia and South Africa, Anita highlights the small but inspiring wins happening on the ground.

She also discusses why stablecoins like USDT are more widely adopted than Bitcoin in many places, and why education and practical tools-not just ideology-are crucial for real adoption in the Global South.
