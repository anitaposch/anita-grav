# How Bitcoin Can Help Stabilize Zimbabwe's Businesses and Farms

## Why Bitcoin Matters in Zimbabwe  
Zimbabwe has changed its currency many times in just a few years. Each version lost immense value. Bitcoin survived them all.  

Bitcoin is:  
- **Ownership**: nobody can take your bitcoin away from you if you hold your own keys.  
- **Stable compared to the national currency**: instead of loosing value like local currency, bitcoin has been adding value over time.
- **Borderless**: bitcoin enables cross-border transactions without restrictions. 
- **People locally want to buy bitcoin**: there is a lot of demand for bitcoin in Zimbabwe that cannot be fulfilled.

> "You wouldn't have to be scurrying to the shops like you do if you've got X amount of Zimbabwean currency, because you know it will get debased or devalued, because bitcoin holds its value over time." says Ethan.

## USDT Is an Option, but Bitcoin Is Value

USDT is the preferred cryptocurrency in Zimbabwe, because everyone wants to use USD rather than ZiG and USDT gives them the properties of fast and cheap borderless payments with predictable fees. Ethan understands this, but he trusts Bitcoin more because [it gives value, it is not just a payment system](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-utility-of-bitcoin-moving-value-like-information), cannot be inflated or controlled by nation states and it is censorship-resistant - all **properties that USDT does not have**. 

> "You can ask as many questions as you want about Bitcoin, but you have to go out, purchase it, hold it, observe it, answer those questions for yourself over a period of longer than just six months, longer than a year, longer than two.", Ethan argues.

## Farming with Bitcoin  

Ethan’s farm shows how Bitcoin can be part of everyday life:  
- **Fish farming**: His team rebuilt the unused school pool into a tilapia fish pond to support a local school with over 500 students. The goal is to generate enough income from fish sales so no child is sent home for unpaid school fees.  
- **Honey production**: Ethan practices biodynamic beekeeping and sells pure honey. Payment is only accepted in bitcoin. The bees also pollinate nearby farms, improving crop yields.  
- **Community projects**: Farm workers run their own side projects, like raising chickens. Part of the profits are saved in bitcoin to give them security in a country without pensions.

## Bitcoin for Business
****what are the advantages for businesses in Zimbabwe to use Bitcoin****?

- Well, I think the advantage is you know that it's going to be there tomorrow when you wake up.
- It's not going to get debased, which is the second part.
- You know nobody can take it away from you.
- And you know you can transact across international borders in order to acquire stuff you need for your business. So really, if you look at those four things I've just mentioned,
- your business will survive because there's no disruption by forces outside of your control.

## Lessons for the Diaspora  
Ethan believes that even Zimbabweans living abroad can use bitcoin to help. If remittances were sent in bitcoin, people could avoid the 2% fees from money transfer companies. Those savings could instead build a “diaspora Bitcoin reserve” to support future community projects at home.  

## Stay on the Farm  
Ethan also runs a small Airbnb cottage on the farm. Guests can stay in Bulawayo, experience farm life, and even learn about beekeeping or aquaculture. Visitors are welcome to pay in Bitcoin and can take part in projects like honey harvesting or helping with mining setups. It is a way to see how Bitcoin fits into daily life while enjoying the peaceful surroundings of the farm.  

## The Bigger Picture  
For Ethan, Bitcoin is not just something to hold. It is something to use. By earning, saving, and spending it, he is creating resilience for himself, his workers, and the local school. Whether it is fish, honey, or cross-border payments, Bitcoin is helping build a small but real circular economy in Zimbabwe.  



We are in Bulawayo where I interview Ethan, a farmer who not only raises fish, bees, and fruit but also mines and accepts bitcoin on his farm.

## From Solar to Sats  
A few years ago, Ethan contacted me from the UK. He wanted to try mining bitcoin on his remote farm in Zimbabwe using solar power. With some second-hand machines and free sunlight, the experiment worked.  

At first, the miners earned around 25 to 30 dollars a week. But more important than the money was the proof:  
- Bitcoin mining worked with solar energy.  
- Payments arrived automatically every day.  
- The sats could cross borders without permission.  

That experience convinced Ethan to find more use-cases for Bitcoin within his business - a farm in Bulawayo. It was his own “proof of work.”  

## Challenges and Security  
Running miners in Zimbabwe is not always easy. At one point, burglars stole the farm’s batteries, which forced Ethan to rebuild and add more security. Lithium batteries later became very expensive, but he continued improving the system step by step.  
Even with these challenges, he sees value in mining: not just earning bitcoin, but also using the heat from the machines to warm fish ponds and greenhouses in the future. In agriculture, nothing should go to waste.
