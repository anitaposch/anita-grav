# What I'm doing now - May 2025

## South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia

I spent January and February in South Africa to speak at the Adopting Bitcoin conference in Cape Town, to conduct some workshops with local initiatives and travel the Garden Route to visit Bitcoin Ekasi for the second time after their early days when I visited in 2022 and to document the places that are accepting bitcoin along the route.

In March and April I lived in Harare, Zimbabwe to share Bitcoin education with members of the civil society and learn and feel what it means to live in a place that is basically working like a dictatorship, where demonstrators and journalists are locked up for months without bail or due process just for criticizing the President or highlighting corruption in government and society.

I traveled via bus to Bulawayo the second largest city of Zimbabwe to be the guest at a meetup sponsored by Bitcoin for Fairness and to mentor a new local education initiative called "YeBo Bitcoin", which BFF will support too.

In March I visited Lusaka, Zambia for two weeks to be a guest speaker at Bitcoin Zambia's educational events and to mentor the organizers.

I am going to spend European summer in Central Europe.
