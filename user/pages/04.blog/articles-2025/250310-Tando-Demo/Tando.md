# Revolutionizing Bitcoin Payments in Kenya - Interview with Tando Founders

Imagine arriving in Kenya with no local currency and still being able to pay for everything using Bitcoin. That’s exactly what Tando makes possible. 52 million Kenyans can now be paid with bitcoin. This innovative application is the missing link between Bitcoin and everyday spending in Kenya.

See it in action! Here I pay a merchant at the Maasai market:

## The Birth of Tando

Sabina and Jason, the creators of [Tando]([https://tando.me/](https://tando.me/)), are passionate Bitcoiners. Their journey started with a simple question: how do we introduce people to Bitcoin in a way that makes sense for their daily lives?

They began tipping taxi drivers and restaurant workers in bitcoin to spread awareness. However, they quickly realized a challenge: most people in Kenya live paycheck to paycheck and need to spend money immediately. The question they kept hearing was, “How can I spend this money?”

The answer wasn’t simple. New users couldn’t be expected to navigate complex exchanges just to convert bitcoin into Kenyan Shillings. That’s when the idea for Tando was born. The real push came after attending the African Bitcoin Conference, where they found the motivation to turn their idea into reality.

## Why the Name Tando?

Tando takes its name from the Ashanti Kingdom’s deity of thunder and lightning. Since the platform is built on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, the name felt like the perfect fit. And now, Tando is revolutionizing the way Bitcoin is spent in Kenya.

## How Tando Works

Tando takes advantage of Kenya’s well-established mobile money infrastructure, specifically M-Pesa. Here’s how it works:

1. A user initiates a Bitcoin payment through Tando.
2. Tando converts the bitcoin into Kenyan Shillings.
3. The Shillings are sent instantly to the recipient’s M-Pesa account.

This means merchants and service providers don’t need to change their existing business processes. They receive local currency, while Bitcoin users can spend their BTC without hassle.

## Driving Bitcoin Adoption

Tando is not just a payment tool - it’s a bridge for wider Bitcoin adoption. By enabling seamless Bitcoin payments via M-Pesa, more people are exposed to Bitcoin without needing to understand the technical details.

The idea is simple: as more people use Tando to spend bitcoin, businesses will begin to see the demand and may start accepting bitcoin directly. One day, Tando hopes to be obsolete - when Bitcoin is accepted everywhere.

## Why is Kenya the Perfect Place for Tando

Kenya is already a mobile money leader, with M-Pesa used by 98% of the population. Practically every shop, from supermarkets to small fruit vendors, accepts M-Pesa payments. Since Bitcoin is also digital money, it fits naturally into the existing mobile payment culture.

Kenya has a population of around 54 million, which means roughly 52 million people already use mobile money. With Tando, they can now interact with Bitcoin seamlessly, and tourists visiting Kenya can also spend their BTC effortlessly.

## The Future of Bitcoin in Kenya

Bitcoin is a global asset worth over $2 trillion (12/2024). With Tando, this wealth can easily flow into Kenya’s economy. It empowers individuals, strengthens financial inclusion, and makes Bitcoin a practical payment method in everyday life.

Tando is changing the game, making Bitcoin spending effortless and bringing the world’s most powerful digital currency to millions of people in Kenya.
