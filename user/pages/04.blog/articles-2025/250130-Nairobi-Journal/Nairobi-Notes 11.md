# Nairobi Journal

## Sunday, Dec 8

Waking up to blue skies in Nairobi, we soaked up some sun on the balcony before getting ready and heading out by 9:45 am for the Satoshi Sisters Brunch at Social House, Nairobi, organized by Charlene Fadirepo. There, we met Renata and Mary from [Fedi](https://fedi.xyz/), Veronicah from [Bitcoin Babies](https://bitcoinbabies.com/), Barbara and Janet from [Gridless](https://bffbtc.org/gridless/), Desiree, and others.

A lively discussion was happening and I participated with some contributions.

We left the event around 12:00 pm and caught a Bolt to JW Marriott Hotel, where the bus to the Human Rights Foundation's event at Gridless offices took off. We had great conversations with fellow builders, entrepreneurs, educators and the HRF team about each others plans for 2025. We eventually caught a Bolt and got home around 9:30 PM.
