# Nairobi Journal: Africa Bitcoin Conference and Project Visits in Kenya

I traveled to Nairobi to attend the Africa Bitcoin conference and connect with the local Bitcoin community. Along the way, I met builders working on exciting projects, interviewed inspiring people, and got a closer look at Bitcoin’s impact in the region. This journal captures my journey. Each day brought new experiences and insights.

## Wednesday, Nov 27

We landed early in the morning at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, happy to see all our luggage had arrived safely. Immigration granted me a 1-month visa and Martina a 3-month visa - why the difference? We have no idea. After a 45-minute Uber ride through Nairobi’s lively streets, we reached our AirBnB in Kileleshwa. We spent the morning settling in and getting familiar with our new space.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1034628921?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241127-traffic"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Later, we downloaded the [Tando.me app](https://tando.me/) on Martina's phone and headed to Carrefour Westgate for grocery shopping. On the way, we tried tipping our Uber driver, Solomon, using Tando and M-PESA. Our first attempt failed, but after contacting Sabina from Tando, we gained access to a Beta testing environment. While we didn’t get it set up in time to pay at Carrefour, we successfully tipped our Uber driver on the ride back to the AirBnB.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1034125222?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="2024-11-27 16-15-21  Taxi Tando MPesa 2"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Back home, we were happy to find that drinking water we ordered had already been delivered to our door. We wrapped up the day by cooking a nice dinner, and Martina tried Tusker, a local Kenyan beer with an elephant logo, marking the start of our Kenyan adventure.

## Thursday, Nov 28

Nairobi feels much bigger and more modern than Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, where we have spent much time. It’s a technology hub with no, almost no potholes, lots of traffic, and many scooters that operate as taxis. Construction is everywhere. The city is very green, filled with trees and parks. There are even well-maintained cycle tracks. Vegetables and fruits from local vendors are slightly cheaper than in Harare, and Uber and Bolt taxis make getting around affordable and easy; something that is not available in Zimbabwe at all. However, the air quality isn’t great due to the heavy traffic and pollution. Around 5 million people live here, compared to 2 million in Harare.

We started the day around 7 a.m. after a good night’s sleep. I handled the jet lag - flying in from New Zealand on a 30 hour trip - surprisingly well. The morning was productive as we submitted the form and photos for the ABC 2024 Social Impact Award and had some good talks about the focus of my work for 2025.

After planning meetings for Friday and Saturday and researching other things to do in Nairobi, like walks in nature, museums, and galleries, we enjoyed a delicious breakfast. Our new discovery: Kenyan macadamia oil for cooking - tastes incredibly good!

In the afternoon, we explored the neighborhood, chatting with street vendors and learning about fruit and vegetable prices. Back at the apartment, we ended the day with a sundowner on the rooftop, watching birds and skies in peaceful reflection. Finally, we reviewed Bitcoin Zambia's grant application to prepare the feedback that the team in Lusaka was asking for.

## Friday, Nov 29

After a short night, I woke up feeling a bit off, but we both managed to squeeze in our first swim in the pool. The morning flew by with scheduling meetings and sending feedback to Bitcoin Zambia on their application.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1034579061?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241129-3-driving-buses"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

By midday, we went to The Promenade/The Garage co-working space (very impressive) to meet with Marcel Lorraine, founder of Bitcoin Dada. We had a great conversation about the Nairobi and African Bitcoin scene.

Following our meeting with Marcel, we met with Jodom, Co-founder of [BITSACCO](https://bitsacco.com/), who also worked from the same co-working space that day. After a friendly introduction and learning that reliable internet costs about $80 per month in Nairobi, we conducted a short interview with him about BITSACCO. He also gave us a preview of the Beta version, with the official launch scheduled for the conference.

Afterwards, we stopped by Carrefour for some shopping, then headed home to cook and finish up some work.

## Saturday, Nov 30

The morning started at home, with some correspondence and organizing the housekeeper. By 9:30, we were heading out for a 10:00 meeting with Sabina and Jason from Tando at Biscotti Café. We’d met them before in Witsand in January 2024, when we were visiting the circular economy with Peter Todd and had dinner at a pizzeria that accepts bitcoin.

We had a great exchange during our breakfast, followed by a short interview with Sabina and Jason about their Tando journey.

At 11:00, we went to the BitDevs Nairobi meetup, hosted by Jodom of BITSACCO and others. There we also met with other Bitcoiners, including Sharon from BTrust, and the developers Simon and Isaac. I contributed to the meetup with hosting the topic about 'Responsible Bitcoin Development', focused on Human Rights aspects, developers’ privacy, and user privacy. The discussion emerged around good practice examples such as wallets that improve user privacy, secure messengers like Signal, etc.

<div id="nostr-embed-note1ctw4auhd88kduxtgvct76n5j7rldzrjwx405pt2gqk9lnzhjp24sqpa9ya"></div><script>  !(function () {    const n=document.createElement('script');n.type='text/javascript';n.async=!0;n.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nostrband/nostr-embed@0.1.16/dist/nostr-embed.js';    const options = {      showZaps: true,      showCopyAddr: false,      hideNostrich: true,      showFollowing: false,    };    n.onload=function () {      nostrEmbed.init(        'note1ctw4auhd88kduxtgvct76n5j7rldzrjwx405pt2gqk9lnzhjp24sqpa9ya',        '#nostr-embed-note1ctw4auhd88kduxtgvct76n5j7rldzrjwx405pt2gqk9lnzhjp24sqpa9ya',        '',        options      );    };const a=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];a.parentNode.insertBefore(n, a);  })();</script>

After the meetup, we enjoyed drinks, pizza, and took a group photo. Then, Sharon joined us at the bar before heading to the Maasai Market in Nairobi’s CBD to shop for gifts for the conference speakers. We had a great time and even picked up a few items for ourselves to take back to Austria, that we paid with bitcoin via Tando.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1034887313?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241130-11"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

The day wrapped up with a visit to ‘Big Fish’ restaurant, where we enjoyed local Tilapia fish with Ugali (the local sadza) and vegetables with Marcel and Sharon reflecting on a busy but exciting day.


## Sunday, Dec 1

We started the day with some exercise, like gymnastics and swimming, all before the lift in the building stopped working - and we are at the 9th floor! The morning was relaxed with coffee, breakfast, and some correspondence. We also organized drinking water and booked an appointment for a massage with Sarah, a Bitcoin DADA scholar recommended by Marcel.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035462542?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241201-1"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

The massage was much different to what we expected from the description, we paid Sarah directly with bitcoin. Her story as a Bitcoin DADA scholar was quite impressive. Her business is listed on BTCmap and she is passionate about spreading Bitcoin knowledge to her friends, family, and future generations. She even bought her car with bitcoin.

The long journey back took us through Nairobi’s high-density embassy neighborhood, with Simon, Sarah’s driver, behind the wheel. Back at the apartment, we cooked, washed off the oils from the massage, and ended the day with some laughs before heading to bed.

## Monday, Dec 2

After a night of heavy rain, we woke up well-rested (though I was awake from 4 am). We headed down to the pool for a 30-minute swim, then climbed the stairs back to our apartment on the 9th floor, getting an extra workout since the lift was still out of order.

<div id="nostr-embed-note1djxq0n8uhuuqz8a49pfr3gexflw7r7lcs46t0jake0f5vc82dmwqhcgla6"></div><script>  !(function () {    const n=document.createElement('script');n.type='text/javascript';n.async=!0;n.src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nostrband/nostr-embed@0.1.16/dist/nostr-embed.js';    const options = {      showZaps: true,      showCopyAddr: false,      hideNostrich: false,      showFollowing: true,    };    n.onload=function () {      nostrEmbed.init(        'note1djxq0n8uhuuqz8a49pfr3gexflw7r7lcs46t0jake0f5vc82dmwqhcgla6',        '#nostr-embed-note1djxq0n8uhuuqz8a49pfr3gexflw7r7lcs46t0jake0f5vc82dmwqhcgla6',        '',        options      );    };const a=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];a.parentNode.insertBefore(n, a);  })();</script>

The morning was spent working from home - handling ABC conference ticket communications, registering for dinners, sharing our meeting with Tando on Nostr, and learning about the ABC Social Impact Award voting process, which requires email verification to send sats. I communicated with the ABC team about the obligation to give away personal data although it could be voluntary too.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6LZiAC8Qhc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Lunch at home, then off to the 'Nairobi Garage' co-working space to meet Marcel Lorraine for an interview. While waiting, we met two other DADAs, Wefe and Adele, and the Maasai market vendor who had supplied gifts for the ABC speakers. We then had a 30-minute interview with Marcel about Bitcoin Dada and DADAdevs. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YFIWdvecZ8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Afterwards, we walked to Westgate shopping mall, buying fresh coconuts from a vendor (who wanted KES 500 for filming, so we passed). At Decathlon, we bought new swimming costumes and a towel, paying in bitcoin with Aqua wallet via Tando for the first time. We also stopped at Carrefour for groceries before heading home. To our delight, one elevator was finally working!

## Tuesday, Dec 3

Waking up to a message that someone wants to donate to BFF and someone else purchasing a [Crack the Orange Course](https://cracktheorange.com/) Master Membership are signs for a good day.

Again we began with some exercise and after coffee at home, we dove into work - X posts, email correspondence, and Crack the Orange applications. Martina finally received her ABC2024 ticket.

I did some laundry, and Martina was excited about yesterday's grocery shopping and ready to cook lunch. But then, we lost running water in our apartment, so we reported it to the AirBnB host before heading out.

Our first stop was the Nairobi Contemporary Art Institute at Rosslyn Riviera Mall. The visit was average, and after a brief stroll through the gallery, we moved on and discovered a massage place. I opted for a 30-minute neck and back massage, which turned out to be much better than our experience with Sarah on Sunday. I paid in bitcoin via Tando again.

Next, we went to Java Coffee for a treat. I enjoyed a Banana Split, and Martina was happy to have real coffee after days of instant. Unfortunately, the cinnamon rolls were out of stock, but we grabbed a ginger scone instead. We had some hiccups with Tando payments, paid twice, but ended up with Kenyan coffee beans and a decaf Americano for me as compensation. We also found a beautiful Kenyan beaded bracelet for me, which we paid for in cash.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wqz-ZUa7rAQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We then called a Bolt and headed home, but the Nairobi traffic (around 6 pm) was intense. During the long ride, the driver, Martin, introduced us to some popular Kenyan music. It wasn’t our favorite, but it was better than the church music playing earlier!

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035845490?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241203-9"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Finally, we made it home, enjoyed a cold drink, and caught up on some work.

## Wednesday, Dec 4

Waking up at 6 am, we caught the sunrise for the first time since arriving in Nairobi, enjoying the view from the rooftop of our apartment. I spent the morning uploading videos and photos from yesterday, as the connection is faster in the morning. Martina took care of some laundry, and we got into our morning routine. The morning was spent on correspondence and finalizing our new grant application, only to find out that applications were closed for now - Bummer! We concluded that everything has its reason and decided to submit some other time. We prepared a delicious breakfast/lunch with plantains, veggies, rice leftovers, avocado, a fried egg, and baguette. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1036235541?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241204-11"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Later we went out with a Bolt taxi to go for a walk to the Arboretum. The driver told us there is only one entrance we can use, which proved to be wrong - he probably just made an extra 100 KES! We started paying the 600 KES entrance fee each with Tando, but the M-Pesa payment process was reversed, meaning Tando couldn't be used. Fortunately, a young woman in the queue behind us offered to help and paid for us, and we transferred the 1200 KES via Tando to her M-Pesa account. When we got the receipt, I realized I had actually paid 1250 KES, with the extra 50 KES being hidden transfer charges. We turned around and gave the friendly woman 100 KES in cash to make up for it. Once inside, we explored, enjoying the monkeys, butterflies, and trees, though there was significant pollution, especially along the river walk.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1036235549?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241204-6"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

At 4 pm, we met with Abubakar Nur Khalil, CEO of BTrust at Java Coffee House by a petrol station around the exit from the Arboretum, where we had initially planned to enter earlier, but the Bolt driver told us it wouldn't be possible ;) We had nice coffee again at Java Coffee House and a great catch-up with Abubakar in a rather unusual meeting place at the petrol station. We discussed technical stuff, various wallets, the space in general, and our upcoming workshop at ABC2024.

Afterwards, we walked home. We passed a police officer who appeared to be directing traffic but looked suspiciously like a fake cop as he was standing at a straight road, where traffic didn't need to be directed. Back home, we went up to the rooftop to watch the evening traffic and hoped for a sunset. Unfortunately, clouds blocked the full view, but the light was still beautiful.

## Thursday, Dec 5

Waking up to BTC 102k USD, we started the day with a mini breakfast on the balcony, observing the progress on the construction site below. I messaged a friend to see if he could assist with a P2P swap BTC to KES. From 10-11 am, we had a video call with Ndesa from Bitcoin Zambia to catch up on some topics regarding our upcoming visit in March 2025.

Afterwards, we had lunch, and surprisingly, the cleaner Sheila came by for a quick clean although this wasn't announced and disrupted our work set up.

We then went through my slides to prepare for the 'Bitcoin for Beginners' workshop next week, filtering what is essential and what is too much into detail and overwhelming for people.

At 3:30 pm, we left for the initial meetup of queer female Bitcoiners at a coworking space in CBD. People shared their stories of being discriminated, almost banned from school, harassed and beaten up on the way to university, their families rejecting them and how females are obliged to pay "Black tax" (a monthly financial contribution to their families), but are not allowed to inherit any property and are excluded from the opportunity to get credit at a bank. It was quite moving to witness this coming together. We felt honored to have been invited to this first meeting, hoping more will follow.

The meeting ended at 6:30 pm, and we headed back to our AirBnB.

## Friday, Dec 6

Woke up well-rested. Went to the gym and on the way up we ran into Winnie, a massage lady, who promoted her services - and we invited her to come and give me a relaxing massage.

I sent out [The Orange Journal newsletter](https://anita.link/news), calling for donations to support Bitcoin for Fairness' ABC Social Impact Award nomination.

Later, I sent bitcoin to a friend in Zimbabwe, who helps us with BFF work. I then focused on preparing slides for the workshop at ABC 2024.

When we prepared to head out, we realized the electricity is out, meaning no hot water, no internet, etc. After checking, we discovered that the apartments electricity tokens had run out. Martina had to organize with the hosts... another Nairobi house story.

By 3 pm, we left for the Friends of BITSACCO meeting at Waitabit Coffee in Gigiri. We met Jodom, Mary, Alex Li, Marcel, Edith, Jason, and others. During the meetup, I did an impromptu interview with El Fuego Mutaz, Head of Africa at Refunite, a speaker at ABC2024, and connected with Meron Estefanos from BTC Innovation Hub Uganda and Fedi. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/txdt3PdVMg0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Before leaving, we bought 10 BITSACCO shares worth KES 10,000 and received limited edition tote bags from Mary. After a nerve wrecking long wait for BOLT, we headed to Sarit Shopping Center in Westlands to buy groceries and gifts for Austria, spending most of our KES cash.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1036960928?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241206-7"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Arriving home late with a female BOLT driver, we faced Tando payment issues but luckily had just enough cash to settle the ride. There's always a little bit of stress involved in pioneering Lightning payments all over Africa. Back at the flat, we managed to recharge the tokens and got the power back on. We enjoyed some reheated leftovers for dinner.

## Saturday, Dec 7

Waking up to a beautiful, blue-sky day! We initially planned to visit Karura Forest, but the amount of traffic jams quickly put us off, so we opted for a 40-minute swim instead.

Back at the flat for a shower, laundry, and some correspondence. I worked on my slides and followed the exciting news on X about Moneybadger in South Africa, now allowing flight payments with bitcoin at [PicknPay](https://youtu.be/ZhRFqXwA9BE). 

For lunch, we headed to Big Fish in Church Street, Westlands via Bolt. We had local Tilapia from Lake Victoria, served with Ugali and greens, and enjoyed refreshing non-alcoholic cocktails with pineapple, mint, and coconut. All paid with bitcoin and Tando. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1037015626?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241207-2-eating-local-fish"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

We took some shots and videos of Westlands before reaching the noisy petrol station environment where the coffee shop was located. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1037015636?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241207-8"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

At 4:00 PM, Winnie, the massage therapist, returned. We enjoyed a relaxing massage and paid Winnie with bitcoin and Tando into her M-Pesa account. Martina then went up to the rooftop to watch the sunset - finally, no clouds! 

In the evening, we reviewed the workshop slides, shared a beer and called it a night.

## Sunday, Dec 8

Waking up to blue skies in Nairobi, we soaked up some sun on the balcony before getting ready and heading out by 9:45 am for the Satoshi Sisters Brunch at Social House, Nairobi, organized by Charlene Fadirepo. There, we met Renata and Mary from [Fedi](https://fedi.xyz/), Veronicah from [Bitcoin Babies](https://bitcoinbabies.com/), Barbara and Janet from [Gridless](https://bffbtc.org/gridless/), Desiree, and others.

A lively discussion was happening and I participated with some contributions.

We left the event around 12:00 pm and caught a Bolt to JW Marriott Hotel, where the bus to the Human Rights Foundation's event at Gridless offices took off. We had great conversations with fellow builders, entrepreneurs, educators and the HRF team about each others plans for 2025. We eventually caught a Bolt and got home around 9:30 PM. 

## Monday, Dec 9

The first conference day! Unfortunately, we missed the opening of the conference but arrived around 11:30 AM. After registration and collecting our conference passes, we went straight to check out the room where my session on 'Bitcoin Introduction and Wallet Installation' took take place.

On our way there, we ran into Meron Estefanos, and a couple of her peers. We all headed to the pool deck together, and I did a short interview with Meron about how Bitcoin supports her work with refugees.

As I was discussing the difficulties of Internet access in Zimbabwe, she also told me about the Starlink Mini device that provides satellite internet and fits into a small rucksack and is very useful in Uganda. It costs around €300 in Europe. I decided to check one out back in Austria.

Next, it was time for my session, which went really well with a great turnout. We filmed the session and took photos. The nice thing was that Humphrey from [Bitcoin Zambia](https://bffbtc.org/bff-zambia/) and [Bitcoin Victoria Falls](https://bffbtc.org/bitcoin-victoria-falls/) was in attendance, and he was excited to hear about our plans to visit Zambia in March 2025. I shared with him how Bitcoin for Fairness facilitates the Alby Lightning node to collect donations.

Afterwards, we met Daniel from Fairdeeds, and I signed his surfboard for the ABC2024 event.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1037714242?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241209-2"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

We then had an informal chat with an Austrian working in Bitcoin mining in Malawi to get to know each other better. I shared about a mining operation in Zimbabwe and our plans to bring Bitaxe miners to the country. 

After that, I helped a friend of Meron to install a wallet and sent her some Satoshis before heading back to the conference venue.

At the conference, I had a good conversation with a fellow entrepreneur, where we discussed my work, some tech stuff, GrapheneOS phones, etc. We briefly saw Pauloes from the Bitcoin Innovation Hub in Uganda and agreed to meet the following day for a quick chat.

We then went across the JW Marriott to the mall to grab a bite to eat, finding a place with some vegetarian Maki to relax a bit. Afterwards, we mingled with a few familiar faces, and suddenly Jack Dorsey was standing next to us chatting with someone. I joined the conversation, Jack Dorsey recognized me and asked how I was doing. I shared my goal for early 2025 to bring Bitcoin knowledge to opposition movements across the continent. After that great conversation, we felt it wouldn’t get any better at the crowded dinner event and we were tired, so we decided to head home.

We ended the evening in our apartment with a small cheese snack, some nuts, and a sip of wine.

## Tuesday, Dec 10

Woke up around 7 am and headed to the gym for a mix of walking, running, and weights, followed by a refreshing 30-minute swim. Feeling great and ready for the day!

After a quick shower, we made our way to JW Marriott, battling heavy traffic and feeling a bit of panic about being on time. But we had a moment to grab a coffee, taste some arrowroot, and enjoy a sandwich. During the coffee break, I met Ramon, Naomi, and Veronicah from the Bitcoin Babies project. We had a nice chat about the field visit on the 12th, and Ramon mentioned he wanted to do a short interview with me.

Sessions started a bit late, so we briefly joined the fireside chat with Jack Dorsey before heading to my panel on 'Unlocking Funding: Bitcoin Project Grants from HRF, Open Sats, and B-trust'. The session was packed, seems like funding for projects draws in a crowd!

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1038069377?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241210-17"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

We ran into Erick from Tanzania, one of the first Crack the Orange students from 2023. Thanks to Prince Akpah, we managed to get him a ticket for the conference.

After lunch, we went back to the hustle and bustle, hanging in the VIP lounge, hoping to catch Renata, but she was caught up in a conversation with Mogashni. 

Next, we attended my BTC DADA: Opportunities for Women in the Bitcoin Ecosystem panel with Renata, Mogashni, and Ella, which was moderated by Marcel.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1038069185?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241210-1"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

After the panel, we hung out with Meron, Paoles, and their group by the pool area. We exchanged experiences about scammers in the Bitcoin space.

We crossed over to the mall, picked up a few things from Carrefour paid in bitcoin of course, and then took a Bolt back home.

## Wednesday, Dec 11

We woke up to the last day of the conference and began the day with some correspondence work. No sports today - just a relaxing morning. At 9 am, Winnie arrived to pamper us again.

By 12:15 pm, we headed out to the conference venue, arriving just in time for lunch. We were joined at the table by Lucas from Satsconf and Raj, the lead of Bitshala from India. Lucas eagerly asked me what it would take to get me as a speaker to Satsconf in 2025.

We attended the African Bitcoiner of the Year ceremony, where Marcel Lorraine of Bitcoin Dada was named the well deserved winner. After the ceremony, we briefly spoke with Josef from Trezor. He donated a Trezor Safe 5 to Bitcoin for Fairness. 

The Afribit Kibera group seemed okay. We met Ronnie and encouraged him to reach out to Martina to apply for a Crack the Orange scholarship. We also met Josh from the Bitcoin Innvation Hub Kampala and shared the Crack the Orange scholarship application link with him.

I had a good exchange with Erick from Tanzania and a German expatriate who has been living in Tanzania for four years. Meanwhile, Martina connected with Sandy from the African Queer Youth Initiative. Sandy, an alumna of DADA Cohort 2, expressed interest in applying for the Crack the Orange scholarship. 

We caught up with Humphrey, who shared his plans to move to Livingstone. I encouraged him to write a solid grant proposal and seek funding from HRF for their Bitcoin VicFalls program. We also reiterated my planned visit to Zambia in March 2025.

At the ABC Social Impact Award [our work with Bitcoin for Fairness was recognized as 2nd runner-up](https://bffbtc.org/abc-social-impact-award/), winning 1 million sats, which will be donated to Bitcoin Zambia.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1038441548?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241211-17"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

On our way out, we ran into the Bitcoin Babies team and confirmed the time and location for the project visit scheduled for the next day.

## Thursday, Dec 12

Around 10:30 am, we headed out to the Bitcoin Babies gathering in Kimbo at Best Ever Garden. I had the idea of ordering a comfortable Uber taxi instead of a cheap Bolt one, because of the length of the journey, and our driver, Camlus and his car, turned out to be wonderful - as the gravel road and potholes were challenging for driver and passengers. He ended up spending the entire day with us, and I compensated him generously for his time and excellent service. Of course I paid in bitcoin via Tando.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1038824329?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241212-19"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

At the gathering, we met the Bitcoin Babies founders - Naomi, Ramon, and Veronicah, the lead for Bitcoin Babies in Nairobi. 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1038824066?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241212-25-1-Naomi-Veronica-1"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

We were introduced to the mothers and children involved in the Bitcoin Babies initiative, as well as some of the merchants accepting Bitcoin payments. I interviewed Naomi and Veronicah while many photos were taken to capture the moments. We all enjoyed a relaxed lunch together.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1038824280?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241212-36"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

After lunch, we visited the merchants who accept Bitcoin payments. An inspiring and at the same time exhausting experience in the heat of the day.

By 4:30 pm, we left Kimbo and headed back into town with Noelyne, who joined us for the ride. In the car, Noelyne introduced me to Machankura's WhatsApp feature. I recorded a short interview while Noelyne demonstrated the feature.

We dropped her off at the JW Marriott, where she had a meeting. 

Back at the flat, we relaxed a bit and then headed to the rooftop. I sent a donation of €250 via Lightning from Bitcoin for Fairness to Naomi to support Bitcoin Babies.

Martina prepared a light dinner while I sorted through videos and other materials. Packing began as we prepared for the next stage of our travels. Another full, productive day ended on a good note.

## Friday, Dec 13

The day began with a peaceful morning swim, a perfect way to start the last day in Nairobi.

Winnie arrived for a final massage session, making sure we felt refreshed and relaxed before our long journey ahead. Parting message from Winnie was that after all the payments we made in bitcoin via Tando, she wants to learn more about Bitcoin and join Bitcoin Dada.

Martina cooked a delicious lunch at the flat, giving us a chance to enjoy one last homemade meal together in Nairobi.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1041543859?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="241213-1"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

At 1:30 pm, we left and made our way to the airport, ready for the long journey back to Europe. It marked the end of an incredible time in Nairobi, full of meaningful connections, inspiring projects, and memorable experiences.
