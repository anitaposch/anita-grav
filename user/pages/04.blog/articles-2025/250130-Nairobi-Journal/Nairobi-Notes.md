# Nairobi Journal: Africa Bitcoin Conference and Project Visits in Kenya

I traveled to Nairobi to attend the Africa Bitcoin conference and connect with the local Bitcoin community. Along the way, I met builders working on exciting projects, interviewed inspiring people, and got a closer look at Bitcoin’s impact in the region. This journal captures my journey. Each day brought new experiences and insights.

## Wednesday, Nov 27

We landed early in the morning at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, happy to see all our luggage had arrived safely. Immigration granted me a 1-month visa and Martina a 3-month visa - why the difference? We have no idea. After a 45-minute Uber ride through Nairobi’s lively streets, we reached our AirBnB in Kileleshwa. We spent the morning settling in and getting familiar with our new space.

Later, we downloaded the [Tando.me app](https://tando.me/) on Martina's phone and headed to Carrefour Westgate for grocery shopping. On the way, we tried tipping our Uber driver, Solomon, using Tando and M-PESA. Our first attempt failed, but after contacting Sabina from Tando, we gained access to a Beta testing environment. While we didn’t get it set up in time to pay at Carrefour, we successfully tipped our Uber driver on the ride back to the AirBnB.

Back home, we were happy to find that drinking water we ordered had already been delivered to our door. We wrapped up the day by cooking a nice dinner, and Martina tried Tusker, a local Kenyan beer with an elephant logo, marking the start of our Kenyan adventure.
