## Saturday, Dec 7

Waking up to a beautiful, blue-sky day! We initially planned to visit Karura Forest, but the amount of traffic jams quickly put us off, so we opted for a 40-minute swim instead.

Back at the flat for a shower, laundry, and some correspondence. I worked on my slides and followed the exciting news on X about Moneybadger in South Africa, now allowing flight payments with bitcoin at [PicknPay](https://youtu.be/ZhRFqXwA9BE). 

For lunch, we headed to Big Fish in Church Street, Westlands via Bolt. We had local Tilapia from Lake Victoria, served with Ugali and greens, and enjoyed refreshing non-alcoholic cocktails with pineapple, mint, and coconut. All paid with bitcoin and Tando.

We took some shots and videos of Westlands before reaching the noisy petrol station environment where the coffee shop was located.

At 4:00 PM, Winnie, the massage therapist, returned. We enjoyed a relaxing massage and paid Winnie with bitcoin and Tando into her M-Pesa account. Martina then went up to the rooftop to watch the sunset - finally, no clouds! 

In the evening, we reviewed the workshop slides, shared a beer and called it a night.
