# Advocating for Human Rights through Bitcoin - Anita Posch on Cryptopulse

This episode is a recording of the conversation I had on the Cryptopulse podcast with Kevin and Ben from the UK. It was recorded in late June 2022.

We’re talking about my journey into Bitcoin, about writing my book, my work in Africa with Bitcoin for Fairness, EU regulation on crypto and my drive to educate.
