# First African Bitcoin only Conference sowing the seeds for further adoption

As soon as the African Bitcoin Conference was announced over a year ago I knew I wanted to be a part of that moment. Since then I have been doing a lot of educational work in South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. I've been to a lot of Bitcoin conferences throughout the years the African Bitcoin Conference was my favorite so far. Organized by Human Rights Activist Farida Bemba Nabourema it was the place where 600 participants from all over the world connected with Ghanaians and attendees from Nigeria, Kenya, Mali, Malawi, South Africa, Cameroon and many more African countries.

The focus of the conference was on Bitcoin as freedom money and not just a tool for speculation and investment. This was only the beginning. Bitcoin only conferences and education will be spreading far and wide across the continent and I hope the focus of all these will be on fighting scams and advancing self-custody and privacy.
