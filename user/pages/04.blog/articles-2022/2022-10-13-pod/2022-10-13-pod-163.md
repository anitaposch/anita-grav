# Podcast: Insights from an African Bitcoin Enthusiast

I'm speaking with Joseph a Bitcoin enthusiast from Africa. Because of his long time interest in Bitcoin he has a lot of experience on how cryptocurrencies are being used within the continent. He has been traveling a lot and as a business owner himself he has made connections with Bitcoin traders and convicted holders. I invited him to get more insights on how cryptocurrency adoption will gain momentum in Africa.
