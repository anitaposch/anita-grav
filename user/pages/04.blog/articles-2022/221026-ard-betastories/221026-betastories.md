# Bitcoin documentary with Anita Posch on German TV

German TV stations ARD and BR published a Bitcoin documentary for which they followed me to South Africa where I worked with Bitcoin Ekasi in May 2022. The Bitcoin township is an example that Bitcoin can be used by anyone even people in less privileged circumstances.

Overall I find the documentary very well done. There are some things factually wrong like when "Tante" is speaking about the CO2 emissions that a single transaction is emitting. It's faulty mathematics. The use of energy for bitcoin does not scale to the number of transactions. The number of transactions that happen on-chain and the number of transactions that happen off-chain - for instance, on second-layer technologies like the Lightning Network or through custodial exchanges that batch transactions - are not correlated to the cost of mining. I dedicated a whole chapter of my [book to the question of Bitcoin’s ecological footprint](https://learnbitcoin.link).

Other outcomes of this journey are:   
* I brought a [raspiblitz](https://twitter.com/raspiblitz) which is connecting [BitcoinEkasi](https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi) with the Lightning and Bitcoin network. As they can verify their own transactions with the node, they are their own bank now.
* we set up [Trezor hardware wallets](https://trezor.com) which are securing the shop owners bitcoin   
* Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin exchange [Paxful](https://paxful.com) opened an education center in the township

Here you can watch the documentary in German (until 25 October 2027):
