# Podcast: How Bitcoin Enforces Human Rights

This is the audio version of my article [Opposing the Corruptible Fiat System, Bitcoin Enforces Universal Human Rights](https://anitaposch.com/bitcoin-enforces-human-rights). This episode lays out how Bitcoin directly enforces seven of the 30 human rights listed on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations. The article shows the correlations between authoritarianism, corruption, inflation and oppression and how financial exclusion is used as an instrument to keep two billions of people worldwide from using a financial service.
