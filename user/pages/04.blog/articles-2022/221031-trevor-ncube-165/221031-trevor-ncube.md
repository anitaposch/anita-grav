# Anita Posch in conversation with Trevor Ncube on influential Zimbabwean channel

Trevor Ncube, a Zimbabwean media entrepreneur influential and well respected throughout Southern Africa, invited me to be a guest on his show "In conversation with Trevor", an honor and pleasure for me.

Ncube was named among the 100 most influential people in Africa in 2012 and 2013. He has currently 270k followers on Twitter. On 10 December 2005, Trevor Ncube had his passport taken away by Robert Mugabe's government, in the first application of restrictive press freedom laws. He exiled to South Africa, now he is back and recording his show in Zimbabwe's capital Harare.
