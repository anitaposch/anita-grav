# Mining Bitcoin With Solar in Zimbabwe - Ep. 157

In this episode I'm talking with a Zimbabwean farmer, who's using solar power to mine bitcoin. This conversation was recorded in June 2022 and I think it's still the only mining operation in the country. It was through BFF that someone donated old ASIC machines to the farmer, those are still profitable due to the free power.

Zimbabwe's monetary system is broken. After decades of mismanagement and corruption the country is running into another hyper-inflation period with 400% inflation in April 2022. Now the first Bitcoin miners arrived! Learn how my guest got into Bitcoin, what he thinks about the use of Bitcoin for Zimbabweans and his thoughts and experiences from mining.
