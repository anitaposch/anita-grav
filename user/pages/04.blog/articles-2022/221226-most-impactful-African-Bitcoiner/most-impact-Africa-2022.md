# #5 Most Impactful African Bitcoiner

I'm happy to share that I've been recognized as the #5 Most Impactful African Bitcoiner of the year 2022. 

I feel very honored and am more than motivated to continue and expand my educational work next year! The plans for 2023 are big. We will launch a Bitcoin online learning program, including Bitcoin For Fairness scholarships for educators, activists and community builders from the Global South. Furthermore, I will spread the word of Bitcoin adoption in Africa at several conferences around the world and continue my grassroot work with local African communities.
