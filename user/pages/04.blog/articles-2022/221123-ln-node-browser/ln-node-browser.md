# Lightning Node in a Browser

Meanwhile Bitcoiners are building and experimenting with solutions for the future.

"BentheCarman" has shown an early version of a Lightning node running on a mobile browser. This would be a huge step forward in making Bitcoin even more uncensorable. Currently wallet apps are distributed through Google's Playstore and Apple's App Store. 

There are concerns though about the security of a Lightning node in a browser as browsers are generally not secure places for storing data. We'll see. There is experimentation going on, that's for sure and I'm optimistic that creative minds will find a secure solution.
