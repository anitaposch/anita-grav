# Podcast: Using Bitcoin In Zambia
Today I’m speaking with Mr. Mulos in Lusaka the capital of Zambia. Mr. Mulos has a YouTube channel, where he shares his insights on how one can exchange Kwacha to bitcoin with different payment methods. He has been helping people with their e-payments for a couple of years now and is a real expert on how to save fees and send money in and out of African countries. Recently he opened his own shop in Lusaka, where people can come by to get help with cryptocurrency and payments.
