# Bitcoin Flyer in Luganda

The [Bitcoin flyer](https://anitaposch.com/bitcoin-flyer) is now available in the second African language after [Swahili](https://anitaposch.com/bitcoin-swahili). The **Ganda language** or **Luganda** is a Bantu language spoken in the African Great Lakes region. It is one of the major languages in Uganda and is spoken by more than 10 million [Baganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganda_people "Ganda people") and other people principally in central Uganda including the capital Kampala of Uganda.
