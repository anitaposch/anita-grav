# What I'm doing now - June 2022

## I'm a nomad

After I traveled to Zimbabwe and Zambia I moved out of my apartment in Vienna to start living as a digital nomad at the end of April 2022. My first journey brought me to South Africa to visit Bitcoin Ekasi in Mossel Bay and connect with Bitcoiners in Cape Town. From there I flew to Oslo to [moderate a panel at the Oslo Freedom Forum](https://youtu.be/MTVPeXQwWCU?t=1669) a conference for human rights activists from all over the world. There I contracted Covid and lay in bed in a hotel in Oslo for a week. Since I was alone I had to decide what to do next. I already had a ticket to fly to Zimbabwe, but I didn't feel good enough and decided to stay in Europe for the summer. 

I have extended travel plans for the second half of the year. I'd like to go to the US, Brazil, Argentina, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa to foster grassroots Bitcoin adoption on the ground. If I can do this depends on the funds I manage to receive from sponsors and donors in the next weeks. If you want to support my work you can do this here: https://anita.link/donate

In June and July I'll work on new content from my African travels and new editions of my [book](https://learnbitcoin.link).
