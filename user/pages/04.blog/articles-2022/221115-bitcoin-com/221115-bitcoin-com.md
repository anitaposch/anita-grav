# Bitcoin.com launches Verse token

After the recent crypto frauds I find it important to explain that Bitcoin.com doesn't represent the ideas of Bitcoin BTC.

The domain Bitcoin.com is under the control of Roger Ver since 2014. "Bitcoin Jesus" as he sometimes is referred to, was one of the loudest proponents of Bitcoin Cash during the Blocksize War in 2017.  That's why I explain the differences in my [(L)earn Bitcoin book](https://learnbitcoin.link).

Now Bitcoin.com started selling their own token called "Verse" to the public. Before they already had two private sales. This is just a grab for your money since Bitcoin Cash has lost 97 % since 2017.

Compare it to Bitcoin.

Why not directly invest in bitcoin? Why do these companies issue tokens? They just want to make a profit. 

And. If Bitcoin.com were true Bitcoiners, they wouldn't issue a token on Ethereum but on one of the Bitcoin sidechains or on Lightning.
