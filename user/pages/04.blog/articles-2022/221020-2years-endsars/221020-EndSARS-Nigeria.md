# How Bitcoin supported Nigerian protests against police brutality

In 2020 the EndSARS movement against police brutality took place. The Nigerian Feminist Coalition supported the demonstrators with food and protection. Soon the Central Bank of Nigeria banned them from using the traditional financial infrastructure to collect donations by cutting off access to their bank account. The tech savvy team started accepting bitcoin to fund their activities against police brutality.

> “We had previously spoken about how Bitcoin is good because your government may shut your bank account down but it was all sort of theoretical but in the last month we were actually living through this. All this stuff we have been saying is actually true and we should be putting a lot of our money or at least enough where you can survive and control it.” – Ire Aderinokun, Nigerian Feminist Coalition
