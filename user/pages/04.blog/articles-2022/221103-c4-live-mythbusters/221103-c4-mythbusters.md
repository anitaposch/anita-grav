# The Bitcoin Myth Busters

As a member of C4's Certified Bitcoin Professional Committee I was part of a live streaming together with special guest Jameson Lopp where we busted myths about security, volatility, scalability and more around Bitcoin. 

A few months ago I was invited to become a volunteering member of the Certified Bitcoin Professional Committee of [Cryptoconsortium](https://cryptoconsortium.org), an organization dedicated to Bitcoin education. One of its Directors is Andreas M. Antonopoulos who has been very influential on my education since I started learning about Bitcoin in early 2017. As such it's an honor to be a part of the [CBP Committee](https://cryptoconsortium.org/team-c4/). And not to forget: as Bitcoin education never ends it's a great opportunity for me to learn from my colleagues.
