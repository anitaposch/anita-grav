# Bitcoin Is the Embodiment of Human Rights - Talk
## The Ultimate Case For Bitcoin: Economic Empowerment & Civil Resistance

### Anita at the Baltic Honeybadger Conference in Riga

Bitcoin brings economic empowerment for billions of people worldwide who have been excluded from the current monetary system by global discriminatory regulations and authoritarian leadership in their countries. Bitcoin is a lifeboat as it gives back self-sovereignty and power to the people. Used as a permissionless means to exchange value it leads to emancipation from financial patriarchy for anyone regardless of race, gender, wealth or status. It enables open and fair access to a global money network that can’t be bent to favor political will or privileged groups.
