Instead of the usual structured meetup, this time the team set up informal, participant-driven discussions. A range of topics were discussed, including hardware wallets, self-custody, seedphrase, etc. One of the participants, Emmanuel, demonstrated how Wasabi wallet works, what Coinjoins are and why they are important.
