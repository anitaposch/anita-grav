# Start using Bitcoin in 5 Minutes

## A video guide to setup the Blue Wallet on your phone

This guide shows you how to install the Blue Wallet on your phone (Android and iOS). Blue Wallet is an open-source and non-custodial Bitcoin wallet and a custodial Lightning wallet. You can receive, save and send bitcoin immediately after the set-up. No registration or email needed. 

**Important UPDATE** Feb 25, 2023
> Blue Wallet announced to sunset its custodial Lightning wallet. You still can use it as a remote for your own node and import other wallets, but there will be no Blue Wallet hosted lndhub anymore. If you currently have funds in the Lightning wallet you should move it to another wallet by April 30 latest.

Be sure to BACKUP your seed (12 words) and save the Lightning backup in a password manager like Bitwarden (free open-source App). If you need to switch to a different phone you import the seed and your wallet with all your bitcoin is restored. 

The Bitcoin wallet is non-custodial, this means that only you have access to your bitcoin. There is no bank or company involved. Custodial means that your Lightning wallet is connected to Blue Wallet's node, meaning you need to trust the makers of Blue Wallet. There are also non-custodial Lightning wallets that you can use for instance the Breez wallet. You could use a combination of the Blue Wallet for bitcoin and Breez for Lightning.
