# What I'm doing now - Sept. 2022

## Traveling Southern Africa

After spending some time in Europe, where I released the [new edition of my book](https://learnbitcoin.link) I returned to Zimbabwe. I'm going to stay here for a few weeks to meet fellow Bitcoiners and share my knowledge with people who are interested in finding solutions for their financial empowerment. Next place will be Zambia, where I'll attend the "Forum on Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFAfrica) 2022". I applied as a speaker, fingers crossed that I'll be able to talk about how Bitcoin enforces human rights.
