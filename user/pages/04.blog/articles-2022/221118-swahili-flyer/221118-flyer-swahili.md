# Bitcoin Flyer in Swahili

A few weeks ago I published the [Bitcoin flyer](https://anitaposch.com/bitcoin-flyer). A 2 page educational pamphlet about Bitcoin. While we were conducting Bitcoin meetups I felt that something was missing. I wanted to have something to give away, that people could take home and was easy and cheap to produce. Because the goal of BFF is to enable local communities to conduct their own meetups without support from outside.

We asked volunteers to do translations. Now there are already [ten versions of the flyer. It can be downloaded](https://bffbtc.org/flyer) in English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Finnish, Italian, French, Catalan and thanks to [Marcel Lorraine from Bitcoin Dada](https://anitaposch.com/more-women-bitcoin) the first African language Swahili was added this week. 

## Swahili Is Spoken by Over 200 Million People

I found an [interesting article about the history of Swahili](https://theconversation.com/the-story-of-how-swahili-became-africas-most-spoken-language-177259). "Once just an obscure island dialect of an African Bantu tongue, Swahili has evolved into Africaâ€™s most internationally recognised language. It is peer to the few languages of the world that boast over 200 million users.

During the decades leading up to the independence of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in the early 1960s, Swahili functioned as an international means of political collaboration. It enabled freedom fighters throughout the region to communicate their common aspirations even though their native languages varied widely.

The rise of Swahili, for some Africans, was a mark of true cultural and personal independence from the colonising Europeans and their languages of control and command. The Swahili word uhuru (freedom) emerged from this independence struggle."

The author calls Swahili a "liberation language". It seems to me that Swahili and Bitcoin are a good fit.
