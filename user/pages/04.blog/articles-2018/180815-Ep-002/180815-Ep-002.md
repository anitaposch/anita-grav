# Andreas M. Antonopoulos on Bitcoin, Privacy, Human Rights and the Future of Bitcoin

Andreas M. Antonopoulos is a best-selling author, speaker, educator, and one of the world’s foremost bitcoin and open blockchain experts with 440,000 followers on Twitter. Since 2012 he is commenting, educating and advising people, businesses and governments about Bitcoin and open Blockchains. He is known for delivering electric talks that combine economics, psychology, technology, and game theory with current events, personal anecdotes, and historical facts. Andreas has been interviewed on the BBC, Bloomberg Business, CNN, The Economist, Forbes and now he is my guest on the Bitcoin & Co. Podcast. In the next 30 minutes we discuss Bitcoin in the context of human rights, privacy, blockchain projects and their impact on society and the economy, how a multi-currency world could look like, what his first purchase with bitcoin was, which books he recommends and - being self-employed since young age - he shares his views and learnings about being an entrepreneur. As you will see Andreas M. Antonopoulos is one of the rare bitcoin and open blockchain experts who approaches the subject from an educational, political, cultural, and human perspective—not only discussing the technology in investment terms.

> "If we get it right, Bitcoin and Blockchains can empower human rights worldwide." - Andreas M. Antonopoulos

> "In the next couple of years we will see strong anonymity and privacy protections using a combination of advanced technologies that are being developed today." - Andreas M. Antonopoulos

> "A transaction worth 255 million of Euros was sent in Bitcoin and the transaction fee was 20 Cents. That is simply impossible to do with the traditional banking system." - Andreas M. Antonopoulos

> "We are gradually moving into an environment where we will have tools that allow us to transfer or exchange any one of these thousands of cryptocurrencies into any of the other in a few seconds, with almost no fee at all, directly peer-to-peer." - Andreas M. Antonopoulos

> "Being an entrepreneur is not about succeeding. It's about continuing to try through success and failures." - Andreas M. Antonopoulos

Andreas and I were talking about [Andreas Schildbach](https://github.com/schildbach), one of the creators of the first bitcoin android wallet, if he is German or Austrian. He is living in Berlin, so I guess he is German.
