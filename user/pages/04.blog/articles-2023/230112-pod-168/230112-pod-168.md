# Podcast: How Bitcoin Solves Financial Apartheid

I’m joined by Ray Youssef, the CEO of Paxful, the peer-to-peer exchange which recently removed Ethereum from their platform and he is the co-founder of Built with Bitcoin. This interview took place at the first African Bitcoin only conference in Ghana at the beginning of December 2022.

As Mark Maraia writes in an article about Youssef in the Bitcoin Magazine: “Youssef is the only person you will ever meet who went _into_ New Orleans shortly after Hurricane Katrina struck and who flew _into_ Egypt on an empty plane while the Arab Spring was becoming very dangerous and who went _into_ Africa eight years ago to better understand how the people from that continent might use Bitcoin as a solution to their economic problems.”

Ray was a guest on my show already in May 2020, [listen in to hear his adventurous story at](https://anitaposch.com/ray-youssef)

Paxful has been doing a lot of educational work in several African countries. The Built with Bitcoin Foundation is a humanitarian organization devoted to creating equitable opportunity by providing clean water, access to quality education, sustainable farming, and humanitarian support—all powered by Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

Today we’re talking about building local communities, how to foster sustainable education, how the lives of people have been changed to the better and about the role Bitcoin is playing.

The Anita Posch Show is hosted on [BTC Podcasting](https://btcpodcasting.com), a Bitcoin for Fairness project, where you can host your podcast for free and at the same time earn bitcoin. Prior solutions required that the host is running their own Lightning node, which is no easy task. At BTC Podcasting we’re working together with Alby to make earning bitcoin accessible for anyone.
