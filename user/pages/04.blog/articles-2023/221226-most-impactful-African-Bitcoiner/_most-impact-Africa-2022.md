# #7 Most Impactful African Bitcoiner

I'm thrilled to share that I've been recognized as the #7 Most Impactful African Bitcoiner of the year 2023. This is the second time I have been in the top 10. This honor is not only a personal achievement but also reflects the growing impact of Bitcoin in Africa.

The support I’ve received has been incredible and motivates me to push boundaries and explore new opportunities to empower human rights. As I look to the future, I am excited to expand my work even more. With a new Train-the-Trainers program and personal assistance on the ground, me and the BFF team will support a new educational initiative in Zambia focused on building a circular economy. Also, we will expand educational offerings to new upcoming Bitcoin initiatives and communities in South Africa and Indonesia. 

Thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way.
