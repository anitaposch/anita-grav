# Introducing the Anita Posch AI Bot: Your Personal Bitcoin Educator

I think it is important to stay ahead with technological developments, that is why I’m excited to announce the launch of the "Anita Posch AI Bot," a GPT-3.5 model designed to be your personal guide in the world of Bitcoin. As a Bitcoin educator, I've always been passionate about making the complex world of Bitcoin accessible and understandable for everyone. Now, with the help of AI technology, this has become more achievable than ever.
Visit [bitcoin-ai.me/anitaposch](https://bitcoin-ai.me/anitaposch) to try it out!

> Be aware: the results of the bot are **EXPERIMENTAL**! Some answers are really great, some are only half correct.

## What is the Anita Posch AI Bot?

The Anita Posch AI Bot is a specialized chatbot that uses content and information exclusively from my channels and publications. This includes my book (L)earn Bitcoin, insights from my [articles](https://anitaposch.com), the [Bitcoin For Fairness initiative](https://bffbtc.org), repositories on GitHub, and transcripts from my videos on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@AnitaPosch). By consolidating these resources, the AI Bot offers a comprehensive and authentic Anita Posch experience. Basically, it’s AI powered Bitcoin know-how from me. 

I want to thank [f418.me](https://f418.me) for providing the technical infrastructure and the setup.

## How Does it Work?

It’s very easy to use. 

1. **Ask your question**: Type in any Bitcoin-related question in the respective field.
2. **Get AI-powered answers**: the AI Bot processes your question and searches through the extensive database of my Bitcoin-related content to respond with accurate, easy-to-understand answers.
3. **Check the sources**: Below the AI generated answers, you will find links to my resources to check and verify sources. 

Please provide feedback, if you encounter incorrect answers. **This is an experimental feature.**
