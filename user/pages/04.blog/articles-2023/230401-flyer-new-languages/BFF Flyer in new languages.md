# Bitcoin flyer in French, German, Slovak and Portuguese Brazilian

Recently I updated the English version of the [Bitcoin flyer](https://anitaposch.com/bff-flyer-23). The Bitcoin flyer is a 2 page folder about the basic characteristics of Bitcoin and how one can use it. We at [BFF](https://bffbtc.org) wanted to offer free educational material to hand out at our meetups. Now our fabulous volunteer translators helped to translate it to Slovak, German, French and Portuguese Brazilian.

You can download, print and use the [PDF](https://bffbtc.org/flyer) for free.
