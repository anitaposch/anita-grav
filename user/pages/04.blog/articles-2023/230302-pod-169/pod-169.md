I'm sharing with you 10 minutes of arguments why Bitcoin is important for the world and especially for the Global South.

The Anita Posch Show is hosted on [BTC Podcasting](https://btcpodcasting.com), a Bitcoin for Fairness project, where you can host your podcast for free and at the same time earn bitcoin. Prior solutions required that the host is running their own Lightning node, which is no easy task. At BTC Podcasting weâ€™re working together with Alby to make earning bitcoin accessible for anyone.

### How to listen to my podcast

This is a [Value4Value](https://value4value.info) bitcoin enabled podcast. This means you can use a lightning wallet like Breez on your phone and send some satoshis to me while listening to the episode. I'm adding images and links to the episode chapters, you can see them on [the Breez app](https://breez.technology), too. It's a podcast app and a non-custodial bitcoin wallet, with a lightning node running on your phone! (available for Android and iOS)
