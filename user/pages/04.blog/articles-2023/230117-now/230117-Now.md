# What I'm doing now - Sept. 2022

## Living in Zimbabwe and planning 2023

In December I [wrote an article for Bitcoin Magazine about the work I did for grassroots adoption of Bitcoin in 2022](/bitcoin-africa-review-2022). After winding down for 2 weeks in the Zimbabwean bush, without Internet(!), I'm focussing on what I want to accomplish in 2023 now. The goal is to work less while reaching a wider audience. Being present on the African continent is important to build trust in a money that has been used for a lot of scams. Online education can reach far more people and it provides a safe space for human rights activists, who might not want to engage with Bitcoin at a public meetup. That's why I'm building a membership program with online courses where individuals and activists can learn how to use bitcoin securely all that within a trusted space. The focus of the program will be on self-custody, privacy and how to earn bitcoin.
