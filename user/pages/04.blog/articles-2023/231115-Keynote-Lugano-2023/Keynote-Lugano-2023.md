# Bitcoin Empowers Africa and Africans Empower Bitcoin | Plan ₿ Forum 2023
I'm excited to share with you the key insights from my recent talk at the Plan ₿ Forum 2023 held in Lugano. The topic of my talk was "Bitcoin Empowers Africa and Africans Empower Bitcoin", and I unveiled the remarkable relationship between a continent on the rise, its enthusiastic people and the monetary revolution. Learn why Bitcoin is a game-changer for Africa and how the enormous contributions of the African community are helping Bitcoin development and adoption globally.

## A Medium of Exchange 
Bitcoin is not just a digital currency but a revolutionary tool that is reshaping the financial and economical landscape in Africa. In regions where traditional banking systems are limited or inaccessible, where authoritarian dictatorships violate human rights, and where high inflation rates increase poverty, Bitcoin gives power to the people. It’s a new medium of exchange that enables Africans to engage in financial transactions and to build wealth.

## Grass Root Adoption
Since my first visit in 2020, I have found that Africans have made an incredible contribution to Bitcoin adoption, e.g. in the form of communities, education, development, businesses and mining. A personal highlight for me was the development of a method to use Bitcoin without internet access or smartphone - a crucial feature for Africa and other remote and developing areas. This innovation is not only a technical breakthrough, but also a proof of the ingenuity and resilience of the African Bitcoin community to cross borders to make financial freedom accessible to all.

## The Future is Bright
At the end of my presentation, I emphasized the need to further support the adoption of Bitcoin in Africa. The enthusiasm and engagement of the audience at the Plan ₿ Forum were palpable, and it is great to see that there is a growing interest to positively impact the continent.

## Watch and Join the Conversation
I invite you to watch the full talk on YouTube and encourage you to join the conversation about Bitcoin's role in shaping the future of Africa.
