# Looking for a BFF volunteer

With Bitcoin for Fairness I have been doing a lot of [educational work on the ground in Southern Africa](/bitcoin-africa-review-2022) in 2022. One of our projects is the [Bitcoin flyer](https://bffbtc.org/flyer), a short and concise intro to use Bitcoin that one can print and give away at meetups. 

![Bitcoin flyer in Swahili](../../articles-2022/221118-swahili-flyer/_swahili-flyer.png)

The flyer has been translated to several languages already, now some amendments need to be done and also I'd like to motivate even more people to translate it to their language.

Our current volunteer who helped organize the translators had to resign. Are you up to do this? The requirement is taking care of our small database of translators, sending emails and explaining how and with which tool (Canva.com) the translators should do their work. You don't need to understand Bitcoin to do this, no proof-reading or such, it's a coordination task.

Would be great to hear from you! [Please apply here](https://anitaposch.com/contact)
