# Why are we bullish? Lyn Alden, Anita Posch, Steve Lubka

I was a guest on BTC Sessions “Why are we bullish?!” live stream. Other guests were Lyn Alden, author of “Broken Money”, she’s one of my favorite Bitcoiners and she was a guest on my show two times and Steven Lubka, managing director at Swan. **Please enjoy! I did.**
