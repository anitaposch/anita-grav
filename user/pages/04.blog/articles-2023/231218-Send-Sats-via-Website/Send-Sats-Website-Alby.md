# Fast and easy payments with bitcoin - Let people send sats via your website

In the Bitcoin community the Value-for-Value ethos is a popular way to show appreciation for content creators. Basically, it means that when you receive value e.g. in the form of information or entertainment, you reciprocate by giving value back in monetary terms and, thus, support the work of the creator. Tipping in bitcoin makes this process simple and direct. 

So, if you like my work and my articles you can tip me directly on this website using the GetAlby wallet extension. In this guide I will show you how you can make it work on your website too.

Thanks to Nostr user "Coco_Ardo" for pointing out this feature.
