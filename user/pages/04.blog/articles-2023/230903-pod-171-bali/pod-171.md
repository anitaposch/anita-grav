The Anita Posch Show is hosted on [BTC Podcasting](https://btcpodcasting.com/), a Bitcoin for Fairness project, where you can host your podcast for free and at the same time earn bitcoin. Prior solutions required that the host is running their own Lightning node, which is no easy task. At BTC Podcasting we’re working together with Alby to make earning bitcoin accessible for anyone.
