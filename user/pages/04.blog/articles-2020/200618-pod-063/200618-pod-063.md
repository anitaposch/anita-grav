# Tim Akinbo: Bitcoin is a Store of Value for the African People - Ep. 063

My guest in this episode is **Tim Akinbo**. He comes from **Nigeria** and is **involved in the Bitcoin space since 2014**. I got to know Tim when I asked for bitcoin donations for a school in Harare, Zimbabwe. He contacted me on Twitter and offered to **setup a BTCpayserver** so that we can receive lightning payments, too. That was of great help. I looked him up and realized that Tim is also a **Bitcoin Core contributor**, Software developer and has a lot of experience with e-commerce and international payments.

> "I think from an individual perspective, Bitcoin will make it possible for people to really, really save, on the African continent." - Tim Akinbo

> "I really have not been able to figure out, if any other Altcoin really has any use case, besides probably providing some avenue for a speculation, but in terms of real world use cases, I don't think that any of the so-called limitations of Bitcoin are strong enough to actually kind of overcome it's network effects and liquidity." - Tim Akinbo
