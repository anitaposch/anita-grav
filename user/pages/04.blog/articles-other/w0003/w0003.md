# Weekly Nr. 3 - Beginning of a bull run

<h2>Thought of the Week by Anita Posch</h2>
<div class="white-box">We are at the beginning of a bull run. It is my second after the one in 2017. When the market price rises, there will be the usual FUD stories soon. About tulips, and bubbles, and the energy consumption of bitcoin, about Chinese mining dominance, and governments banning bitcoin and so on. Scammers will try to scam you. Your neighbor asks you about bitcoin. The bull run will end and the naysayers will laugh at you. In four years the cycle starts again. And since you HODLed the whole time you will be the one getting the last laugh.</div>
