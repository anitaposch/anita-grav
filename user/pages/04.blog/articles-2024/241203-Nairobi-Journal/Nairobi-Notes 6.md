# Nairobi Journal

## Tuesday, Dec 3

Waking up to a message that someone wants to donate to BFF and someone else purchasing a [Crack the Orange Course](https://cracktheorange.com/) Master Membership are signs for a good day.

Again we began with some exercise and after coffee at home, we dove into work - X posts, email correspondence, and Crack the Orange applications. Martina finally received her ABC2024 ticket.

I did some laundry, and Martina was excited about yesterday's grocery shopping and ready to cook lunch. But then, we lost running water in our apartment, so we reported it to the AirBnB host before heading out.

Our first stop was the Nairobi Contemporary Art Institute at Rosslyn Riviera Mall. The visit was average, and after a brief stroll through the gallery, we moved on and discovered a massage place. I opted for a 30-minute neck and back massage, which turned out to be much better than our experience with Sarah on Sunday. I paid in bitcoin via Tando again.

Next, we went to Java Coffee for a treat. I enjoyed a Banana Split, and Martina was happy to have real coffee after days of instant. Unfortunately, the cinnamon rolls were out of stock, but we grabbed a ginger scone instead. We had some hiccups with Tando payments, paid twice, but ended up with Kenyan coffee beans and a decaf Americano for me as compensation. We also found a beautiful Kenyan beaded bracelet for me, which we paid for in cash.

We then called a Bolt and headed home, but the Nairobi traffic (around 6 pm) was intense. During the long ride, the driver, Martin, introduced us to some popular Kenyan music. It wasn’t our favorite, but it was better than the church music playing earlier!

Finally, we made it home, enjoyed a cold drink, and caught up on some work.
