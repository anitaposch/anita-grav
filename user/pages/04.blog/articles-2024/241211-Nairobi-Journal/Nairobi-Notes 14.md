# Nairobi Journal

## Wednesday, Dec 11

We woke up to the last day of the conference and began the day with some correspondence work. No sports today - just a relaxing morning. At 9 am, Winnie arrived to pamper us again.

By 12:15 pm, we headed out to the conference venue, arriving just in time for lunch. We were joined at the table by Lucas from Satsconf and Raj, the lead of Bitshala from India. Lucas eagerly asked me what it would take to get me as a speaker to Satsconf in 2025.

We attended the African Bitcoiner of the Year ceremony, where Marcel Lorraine of Bitcoin Dada was named the well deserved winner. After the ceremony, we briefly spoke with Josef from Trezor. He donated a Trezor Safe 5 to Bitcoin for Fairness. 

The Afribit Kibera group seemed okay. We met Ronnie and encouraged him to reach out to Martina to apply for a Crack the Orange scholarship. We also met Josh from the Bitcoin Innvation Hub Kampala and shared the Crack the Orange scholarship application link with him.

I had a good exchange with Erick from Tanzania and a German expatriate who has been living in Tanzania for four years. Meanwhile, Martina connected with Sandy from the African Queer Youth Initiative. Sandy, an alumna of DADA Cohort 2, expressed interest in applying for the Crack the Orange scholarship. 

We caught up with Humphrey, who shared his plans to move to Livingstone. I encouraged him to write a solid grant proposal and seek funding from HRF for their Bitcoin VicFalls program. We also reiterated my planned visit to Zambia in March 2025.

At the ABC Social Impact Award [our work with Bitcoin for Fairness was recognized as 2nd runner-up](https://bffbtc.org/abc-social-impact-award/), winning 1 million sats, which will be donated to Bitcoin Zambia.

On our way out, we ran into the Bitcoin Babies team and confirmed the time and location for the project visit scheduled for the next day.
