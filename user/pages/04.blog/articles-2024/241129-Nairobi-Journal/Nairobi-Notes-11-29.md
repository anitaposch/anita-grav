# Nairobi Journal

## Friday, Nov 29

After a short night, I woke up feeling a bit off, but we both managed to squeeze in our first swim in the pool. The morning flew by with scheduling meetings and sending feedback to Bitcoin Zambia on their application.

By midday, we went to The Promenade/The Garage co-working space (very impressive) to meet with Marcel Lorraine, founder of Bitcoin Dada. We had a great conversation about the Nairobi and African Bitcoin scene.

Following our meeting with Marcel, we met with Jodom, Co-founder of [BITSACCO](https://bitsacco.com/), who also worked from the same co-working space that day. After a friendly introduction and learning that reliable internet costs about $80 per month in Nairobi, we conducted a short interview with him about BITSACCO. He also gave us a preview of the Beta version, with the official launch scheduled for the conference.

Afterwards, we stopped by Carrefour for some shopping, then headed home to cook and finish up some work.
