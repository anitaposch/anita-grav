# Nairobi Journal

## Thursday, Nov 28

Nairobi feels much bigger and more modern than Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, where we have spent much time. It’s a technology hub with no, almost no potholes, lots of traffic, and many scooters that operate as taxis. Construction is everywhere. The city is very green, filled with trees and parks. There are even well-maintained cycle tracks. Vegetables and fruits from local vendors are slightly cheaper than in Harare, and Uber and Bolt taxis make getting around affordable and easy; something that is not available in Zimbabwe at all. However, the air quality isn’t great due to the heavy traffic and pollution. Around 5 million people live here, compared to 2 million in Harare.

We started the day around 7 a.m. after a good night’s sleep. I handled the jet lag - flying in from New Zealand on a 30 hour trip - surprisingly well. The morning was productive as we submitted the form and photos for the ABC 2024 Social Impact Award and had some good talks about the focus of my work for 2025.

After planning meetings for Friday and Saturday and researching other things to do in Nairobi, like walks in nature, museums, and galleries, we enjoyed a delicious breakfast. Our new discovery: Kenyan macadamia oil for cooking - tastes incredibly good!

In the afternoon, we explored the neighborhood, chatting with street vendors and learning about fruit and vegetable prices. Back at the apartment, we ended the day with a sundowner on the rooftop, watching birds and skies in peaceful reflection. Finally, we reviewed Bitcoin Zambia's grant application to prepare the feedback that the team in Lusaka was asking for.
