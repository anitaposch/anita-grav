# Nairobi Journal

## Sunday, Dec 1

We started the day with some exercise, like gymnastics and swimming, all before the lift in the building stopped working - and we are at the 9th floor! The morning was relaxed with coffee, breakfast, and some correspondence. We also organized drinking water and booked an appointment for a massage with Sarah, a Bitcoin DADA scholar recommended by Marcel.

The massage was much different to what we expected from the description, we paid Sarah directly with bitcoin. Her story as a Bitcoin DADA scholar was quite impressive. Her business is listed on BTCmap and she is passionate about spreading Bitcoin knowledge to her friends, family, and future generations. She even bought her car with bitcoin.

The long journey back took us through Nairobi’s high-density embassy neighborhood, with Simon, Sarah’s driver, behind the wheel. Back at the apartment, we cooked, washed off the oils from the massage, and ended the day with some laughs before heading to bed.
