# What I'm doing now - August 2024

## Recharging and planning work in Africa with BFF

I‘m in Austria recharging my batteries and planning projects in Kenya, South Africa and Zambia for the months between December and April 2025.

I try to minimize the vast amount of influences from outside to come to rest with my inner state. For this and for privacy reasons I deleted my old Facebook page, Telegram, Instagram and my Strava account. Simply reducing my online footprint and distractions. At the moment I am setting up a new phone free from surveillance of the big two Google and Apple.
