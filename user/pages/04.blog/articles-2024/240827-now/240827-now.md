# What I'm doing now - August 2024

## Recharging and planning work in Africa with BFF

Iâ€˜m in Austria recharging my batteries and planning projects in Kenya, South Africa and Zambia for the months between December and April 2025.

I try to minimize the vast amount of influences from outside to come to rest with my inner state. For this and for privacy reasons I deleted my old Facebook page, Telegram, Instagram and my Strava account. Simply reducing my online footprint and distractions. At the moment I am setting up a new phone free from surveillance of the big two Google and Apple.
