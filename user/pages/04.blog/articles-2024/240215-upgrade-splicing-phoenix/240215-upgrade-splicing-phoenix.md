# Upgrade your existing Phoenix Wallet for Splicing

Are you a beginner in the Bitcoin world, curious about fast and efficient Bitcoin payments? I highly recommend using the self-custody Lightning Wallet from Phoenix, a user-friendly option for those starting their Bitcoin journey. If you haven’t installed it yet, you can do it now with my [Phoenix Wallet tutorial](https://anitaposch.com/lightning-self-custody-phoenix) and you don't need to do the upgrade that's mentioned below.

I'll walk you through the process of upgrading your existing Phoenix Wallet to its latest version. [This update brings a key feature - the Auto Channel Management (splicing)](https://acinq.co/blog/phoenix-splicing-update).

It's important to know that this upgrade will close all your existing channels and Phoenix will automatically open new ones for you. But don't worry -  I'll guide you through the entire process.

## Step-by-Step Guide

* **Initiate the Upgrade:** On your Phoenix Wallet app, you'll see an option to upgrade. Tap on 'Upgrade' > 'Prepare Migration' to start. The app will inform you that your channels will be merged and the process is automated. It's important not to reuse old swap-in Bitcoin addresses after the upgrade.

* **Confirm Migration:** Confirm the migration by pressing ‘Proceed’, and the app will start processing. It will close your existing channels and open a new one. You'll see a message confirming the migration is complete.

* **New On-chain Bitcoin Addresses:** Post-migration, you'll have new on-chain Bitcoin addresses. These are now uniquely yours, no longer shared with Phoenix as in the previous setup. Congrats! 

* **Channel Management:** In the settings, you can now see the 'Automated Channel Management' option, replacing the earlier channel list.
