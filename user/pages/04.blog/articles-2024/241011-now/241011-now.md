# What I'm doing now - October 2024

## Nashville to Auckland

Last week I was in Nashville and attended the Human Rights Foundationâ€™s second annual Global Bitcoin Summit, which brought together more than 100 rights defenders, developers, educators, grant-makers, and community organizers from 60 countries and 6 continents to further expand the impact of Bitcoin, a technology that is changing the lives of millions of people and serving as a financial tool for human rights activists, civil society organizations, and journalists worldwide.

On Friday I left Nashville, crossed the Pacific to arrive in Auckland, New Zealand on Sunday morning. It seems to me that no place exists that's further away from Austria than the Kiwi country. I already met some Bitcoin users, who helped me exchange my bitcoin to cash and we went to drink coffee together to discuss education, wallets and other topics. It's really nice to be welcomed like that by people who have never met me and vice versa, nonetheless it feels safe to meet them. I'm going to spend some time in New Zealand.
