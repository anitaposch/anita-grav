# Nairobi Journal

## Friday, Dec 6

Woke up well-rested. Went to the gym and on the way up we ran into Winnie, a massage lady, who promoted her services - and we invited her to come and give me a relaxing massage.

I sent out [The Orange Journal newsletter](https://anita.link/news), calling for donations to support Bitcoin for Fairness' ABC Social Impact Award nomination.

Later, I sent bitcoin to a friend in Zimbabwe, who helps us with BFF work. I then focused on preparing slides for the workshop at ABC 2024.

When we prepared to head out, we realized the electricity is out, meaning no hot water, no internet, etc. After checking, we discovered that the apartments electricity tokens had run out. Martina had to organize with the hosts... another Nairobi house story.

By 3 pm, we left for the Friends of BITSACCO meeting at Waitabit Coffee in Gigiri. We met Jodom, Mary, Alex Li, Marcel, Edith, Jason, and others. During the meetup, I did an impromptu interview with El Fuego Mutaz, Head of Africa at Refunite, a speaker at ABC2024, and connected with Meron Estefanos from BTC Innovation Hub Uganda and Fedi.

Before leaving, we bought 10 BITSACCO shares worth KES 10,000 and received limited edition tote bags from Mary. After a nerve wrecking long wait for BOLT, we headed to Sarit Shopping Center in Westlands to buy groceries and gifts for Austria, spending most of our KES cash.

Arriving home late with a female BOLT driver, we faced Tando payment issues but luckily had just enough cash to settle the ride. There's always a little bit of stress involved in pioneering Lightning payments all over Africa. Back at the flat, we managed to recharge the tokens and got the power back on. We enjoyed some reheated leftovers for dinner.
