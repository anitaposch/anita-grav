# Nairobi Journal

## Friday, Dec 13

The day began with a peaceful morning swim, a perfect way to start the last day in Nairobi.

Winnie arrived for a final massage session, making sure we felt refreshed and relaxed before our long journey ahead. Parting message from Winnie was that after all the payments we made in bitcoin via Tando, she wants to learn more about Bitcoin and join Bitcoin Dada.

Martina cooked a delicious lunch at the flat, giving us a chance to enjoy one last homemade meal together in Nairobi.

At 1:30 pm, we left and made our way to the airport, ready for the long journey back to Europe. It marked the end of an incredible time in Nairobi, full of meaningful connections, inspiring projects, and memorable experiences.
