Early morning arrival at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. All our luggage arrived safely. Transfer from Airport to our Airbnb in Kileleshwa with Uber.

Arrival in our apartment mid morning, checking in and making us familiar and comfortable. Since we don't have any Kenyan Shillings (KES), we immediately start to install Tando.me app on an Android phone that's using the Google Play Store after the app didn't work on the alternative GrapheneOS. Many apps integrate Google Services, which means they are not fully functional or not functional at all on other systems. For instance the self-custodial Phoenix wallet is working nicely on Graphene, but it lacks push notifications that are managed by Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging. If you can deal without the notifications, it works well. Tando didn't work at all, I reported this to the team and they noted it. Hopefully they can build around that problem so that the app can be used without Google Services.

Heading out with Uber to do a grocery shop at Carrefour Westgate shopping mall. On the way there testing to tip our Uber driver Solomon with Tando.me / M-PESA. After initial failure after creating an invoice we connected with Tando and got access to a Beta testing environment. Sadly we didn't get the access in time to settle our shop at Carrefour, but tipping our next Uber driver back to our Airbnb worked out fine. Now we are good to go.

Back home in the apartment we were happy to see that some drinking water had been delivered to our door step. We started cooking a nice dinner, Martina tested the first local Kenyan beer, Tusker, with an elephant as their label.

Quiet evening at home
