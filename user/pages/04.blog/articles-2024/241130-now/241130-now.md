# What I'm doing now - December 2024

## Nairobi Meeting Locals and AfroBitcoin

My first visit to Kenya! I wanted to go in a long time as Nairobi is one of the most vibrant cities in Africa. Also there are some exciting tech projects in the Bitcoin space that I'm going to visit to learn about local challenges and their creative solutions. 

December 9-11, the third edition of the AfroBitcoin conference takes place. My third visit too.
