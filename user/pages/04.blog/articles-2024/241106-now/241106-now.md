# What I'm doing now - November 2024

## On the Road with Bitcoin Meetups in New Zealand

I call it a vacation. Others might say, but you're still working. I say, that's right, but only a little bit. When you're driven by enthusiasm and your goals and you're self-employed and a workaholic, then it's really hard to not work at all. Personally, I feel that I totally have reduced my workload during the last weeks traveling New Zealand.

Mostly I hear about traveler and digital nomad paradises like Bali or Thailand, I have been to Bali, I have been to El Salvador, I have been to many places and New Zealand tops them all. Such a beautiful country, friendly people, great infrastructure and if you enjoy the quiet like I do, then you found paradise. 

I also found and attended Bitcoin meetups in Auckland and Tauranga. It's always nice to engage with like-minded people. 

In Wellington I met with [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs), author of several books, ["How to Live"](https://sive.rs/h) is my favorite so far, and former founder and CEO of "CD Baby". He's a minimalist, a traveler, has been a circus performer and musician and loves a different point of view. We found that we're having a lot in common for instance the drive to use independent and self-sovereign technologies. Derek is self-publishing his books as well as I do. We met for two hours and time flew as we had a lot to talk about.

In a couple of weeks I'll be flying to attend the [Afrobitcoin](https://afrobitcoin.org) conference in Nairobi, Kenya.
