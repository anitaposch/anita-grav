# Daily Posts on Nostr

It's early January 2026 and this is my experiment. I will publish one note per day. On Nostr first.

As it's already Jan 4 the experiment has failed before it even started. I missed day 1 and 2, here is my [post from Jan 3](https://yakihonne.com/note/nevent1qgs9etvzezvwuespxugeghtg0a7e2j0kgksprpr8mt30tcn5ckvddlcpz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhsqgr6eq2sazt7vmeymwzq5s20x6fstym6gn6aer3wjqtqn9gu58cv4sy4fcet).

Nonetheless - the best day to start with anything that gives you practice and agency is today.

[Nostr](/nostr) stands for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays". It's a new and open protocol, imagine a new life form of the Internet. It lives on decentralized servers (called relays) that anyone can run without permission. It's censorship resistant, no one can keep you from expressing your opinion or change or delete what you wrote. You can use any app and switch in between apps, as all content belongs to you, and unlike X, Facebook or YouTube you don't lose your content when you switch. You can decide what you want to see in your feed, there is no algorithm (yet) and if it were, you can just switch to another app. You don't have to upload your ID, no one can block or freeze your account as there are no accounts on Nostr. Ownership of your data is secured by crypto-graphical keys (long strings of random letters and numbers that are mathematically impossible to guess).

Does this sound familiar? These are Bitcoin's foundations. Nostr is for content, what Bitcoin is for value. Bitcoin doesn't need Nostr and Nostr doesn't need Bitcoin, but they work brilliantly together. You can send "zaps" (bitcoin micropayments) directly to content creators in seconds. Bitcoin and Nostr are the Swiss Army knife of financial expression and free speech. Tools that give agency back to people. Tools that enable the civil society to uphold their important function of being a check on power. That's why I am going all in on Nostr and publish my daily posts on Nostr first.
