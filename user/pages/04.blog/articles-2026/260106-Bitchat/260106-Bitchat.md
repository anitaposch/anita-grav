# Bitchat: Enabling Agency

In 1997 my first Internet connection was installed. The modem worked slowly via landline. I knew nothing about how it worked, but I knew it would change the world.  The opportunity to communicate globally unlocked possibilities.

In the decades since, the Internet has been captured by monopolistic corporations and government interests. The dream of online agency and self-determination briefly came true around 2010 culminating in the Arab Spring.

In March 2025, Zimbabwe's government throttled the Internet to suppress protests. I experienced my first Internet shutdown. Luckily, I had a Starlink receiver - though Zimbabwe-licensed units ([required by law for locals also in other countries](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/06/papua-new-guinea-internet-starlink-shut-down)) were likely shut down too.

Internet throttling on election days has become common in authoritarian countries. Under the guise of national security, governments stifle demonstrations and limit free speech. Uganda faced shutdowns during 2021 elections. Now, ahead of the January 15, 2026 election, opposition leader Bobi Wine is promoting Bitchat to bypass government control.

Bitchat is an app that uses your phone's Bluetooth to send messages to people nearby. Each phone is a node in a spontaneous network. No centralized server, no mobile data or cellular service needed. Just a powered phone and Bluetooth.

The Uganda Communications Commission has [warned that the government can disable Bitchat](https://nilepost.co.ug/news/312962/don%E2%80%99t-be-excited-by-bitchat,-ucc-boss-warns-ugandans). I wish them luck. It's technically impossible to remotely shut down Bluetooth on individual phones without confiscating every device. The government could block app stores, but Bitchat is available on alternative platforms like Aurora Store and [GitHub](https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat).

Bitchat's success depends on one thing: how many people download it. It gets stronger the more people participate, doesn't depend on permission from authorities, and puts power directly in people's hands.

Fun fact: In 1997 the name "Bluetooth" was proposed for the short-range wireless technology based on an analogy that it would unite devices the way King Harald Bluetooth united the tribes of Denmark in the 10th-century.
