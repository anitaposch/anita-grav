# In Or Out of CRYPTO

> Bitcoin is a R.I.P.C.O.R.D. It is Revolutionary, Immutable, Public, Collaborative, Open, Resistant to censorship, Decentralized. - Andreas M. Antonopoulos.

In the face of Meme-coins like Trumpcoin, Doge or controlled blockchains like Ripple, Solana or Cardano I add:

> C.R.Y.P.T.O. is Controlled, Rug-pullable, Yield-obsessed, Pump-and-Dump, Token-printing, Obsolete, Censorable. - Anita

Within many definitions Bitcoin classifies as a cryptocurrency too. Bitcoin invented the whole field of cryptographic money, but thousands of Altcoins that spread over the years do not adhere to the same strict principles of neutrality and decentralization.

They are neither revolutionary inventions nor permissionless, neutral or uncensorable. Their existence has been controlled from the very beginning. Pre-mining offered advantages for an exclusive round of investors, foundations and founders influence the discourse around technical development and consensus. They are neither the new or better Bitcoin, they are a rip-off made to enrich a few akin to a scam. 

Not all Altcoins are scams, it's truly hard to differentiate, you'd need to study each and every one of them - an impossible task. To opt-out you choose Bitcoin, to stay in the system you gamble with Altcoins.
