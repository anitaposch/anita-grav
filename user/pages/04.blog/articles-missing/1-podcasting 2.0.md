# Value 4 Value and Podcasting 2.0: How to earn bitcoin with content creation

Anita Posch presents how you can build a self-sustaining decentralized ecosystem for podcasting with bitcoin. [Podcasting 2.0](https://anitaposch.com/bitcoin-co-podcast-one-of-the-first-to-enable-streaming-money/) is an open movement that was initiated by the “podfather” Adam Curry and developer Dave Jones. Learn about the business of podcasting and how you can set up your own podcast tribe in combination with a Lightning Node in the Sphinx Chat app.

Goals are

-   Free podcasting from corporate control and walled gardens
-   Secure free speech, uncensorable media
-   Open system, everyone can be a host, join and use it
-   No ads, no data collection
-   Income generation for content creators and developers
-   Enable the Value for Value model and pay what you want
