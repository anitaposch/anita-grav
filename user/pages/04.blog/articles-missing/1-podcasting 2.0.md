# Podcasting 2.0: How to earn bitcoin with content creation

Anita Posch presents how you can build a self-sustaining decentralized ecosystem for podcasting with bitcoin. [Podcasting 2.0](https://anitaposch.com/bitcoin-co-podcast-one-of-the-first-to-enable-streaming-money/) is an open movement that was initiated by the “podfather” Adam Curry and developer Dave Jones.

Goals are

-   Free podcasting from corporate control and walled gardens
-   Secure free speech, uncensorable media
-   Open system, everyone can be a host, join and use it
-   No ads, no data collection
-   Income generation for content creators and developers
-   Enable the Value for Value model and pay what you want
