If you ever get overwhelmed by the fact, that as a Bitcoiner people will dismiss you, will argue with you, call Bitcoin a scam and many things more, then remind yourself of the fact, that you are an early-adopter, a misfit, a person with vision and the guts to tell others what there is to come. Throughout the history inventors, visionaries, entrepreneurs were laughed at.
