# Bitcoin lecture at University of Zambia

I was invited to speak at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Zambia on Friday Sept. 30, 2022. The lecture consisted of a Bitcoin primer, talking about the technology behind the Bitcoin blockchain, it's unique properties, the 21 million limit, what mining is, the staircase to financial sovereignty, how to self-custody and how to earn bitcoin. At the end of the session the students installed the Muun or Blue Wallet on their phones and we walked through the set-up and backup process and I sent them a small amount of bitcoin for demonstration.

You can find the presentation below the video and images:
