### Advocating for Human Rights through Bitcoin

This episode is a recording of the conversation I had on the Cryptopulse podcast with Kevin and Ben from the UK. It was recorded in late June 2022.

Weâ€™re talking about my journey into Bitcoin, about writing my book, my work in Africa with Bitcoin for Fairness, EU regulation on crypto and my drive to educate.
