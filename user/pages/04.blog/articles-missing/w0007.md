# Bitcoin use-age around the world

<h2>Thought of the Week by Anita Posch</h2>

[![Satoshi's last message](assets/_W0007-Satoshi-last-message.jpg)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.msg29280#msg29280)

<strong>10 years ago</strong>, on Dec 11 <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.msg29280#msg29280" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Satoshi Nakamoto left the last public message on the bitcointalk forum</a>. Since then nothing. He/she/they might be dead. Many people believe Hal Finney was Satoshi, but nobody knows. I think it is a good thing, that nobody knows. There are no leaders in Bitcoin. That is essential for being a neutral technology.

Last week I wrote about the <a href="https://anitaposch.com/anitas-weekly-5-dec-11th-2020/">Ledger scam trying to steal your money</a> by tricking you into typing your seed phrase into a website. This week I am asking you to always double- and triple-check, if you are on the right website, the correct URL if you are downloading wallet software or other bitcoin related tools. Scammers are much better today than the "Nigerian prince". Sometimes only a small dot is making the difference between legit and scam.

Would you notice the small dot above the letter?<br><br>Always verify the url and website you are on. This phishing site (electrum with an ė) will steal your funds, get your girl/man, and make your overall life miserable. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://t.co/3sGVHfLsMP">pic.twitter.com/3sGVHfLsMP</a></p>&mdash; Ron Stoner (@forwardsecrecy) <a href="https://twitter.com/forwardsecrecy/status/1337495822057914368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<strong>Bitcoin Sets $20K Record, Investors Expect Rally to Continue as Alternative to Gold</strong>
Oh my, even <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-sets-20k-record-investors-expect-rally-continue-alternative-gold-1555370" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Newsweek had a Bitcoin article</a> this week. And as always in mainstream media: <strong>it's about price action only</strong>. Let's remind ourselves of the far more important tool that Bitcoin is. It is giving open access without asking someone for permission and a neutral technology that enables more fairness. I am talking with <strong>Andreas M. Antonopoulos</strong> today about how we can help that Bitcoin is staying this open tool. Our interview will be out on Dec 31 on my podcast and as video on YouTube.
