# Bitcoin Learnings from Zimbabwe and Botswana

In February 2020 I travelled to Zimbabwe and Botswana to learn more about the usage of <a href="https://bitcoinundco.com/en/bitcoin-in-africa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bitcoin in Africa and to present the findings in my 6-part podcast series</a>.
