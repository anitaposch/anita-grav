# Bitcoin communities drive adoption in Africa

I was interviewed by Hannatu Asheolge for TechCabal at the beginning of October 2022. She asked about my work with Bitcoin for Fairness in Africa and we discussed the role of Bitcoin for human rights activists and opposition based on the example of the Nigerian Feminist Coalition. The result is an informative [article mentioning different projects and initiatives fostering Bitcoin adoption on the African content](https://techcabal.com/2022/10/07/how-bitcoin-communities-in-africa-are-fostering-bitcoin-adoption/).

## Bitcoin for a fair financial system

> "We live in an unfair world, but bitcoin is open-neutral internet technology, which just like the internet, allows people to transact freely. It is neutral and takes no sides regardless of race, gender, nationality or social/financial status. No one can freeze Bitcoin transactions or interfere with them, which is a very useful tool in todayâ€™s social and political climate." - Anita Posch
