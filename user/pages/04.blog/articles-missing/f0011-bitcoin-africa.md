## Is Africa the Next Hotbed of Crypto Adoption?

Anita was a [guest at CoinDesk's podcast "Opinionated"](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/opinionated/is-africa-the-next-hotbed-of-crypto-adoption-feat-anita-posch) to talk about her experiences from Africa.

What can Bitcoin do in a country where less than a half of the population has access to the internet? Why is it easier for Africans abroad to send money back home via bitcoin? The KYC/AML (know-your-customer/anti-money-laundering) policies in crypto around the world are getting stricter – how will that affect people in Africa, where personal IDs aren’t widespread?

Anita shares her thoughts on how Bitcoin use in Africa is different from that in Europe and the U.S., and a possible future for African central bank digital currencies under China’s influence, and she gets into a heated debate with Ben on bitcoin’s viability as a form of payment given its volatility.
