# Bitcoin flyer
Today I released the [Bitcoin flyer](https://bffbtc.org/flyer). A 2 page pamphlet about the basic characteristics of Bitcoin and how one can use it. I wanted to be able to hand-out something to meetup participants and interested beginners. The flyer is open-sourced and will be translated to many languages including African languages like Shona or Bemba.
