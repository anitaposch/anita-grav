# Protect yourself

<h2>Thought of the Week by Anita Posch</h2>
Many new Bitcoiners coming to the space are not interested in Bitcoin as a tool for self-sovereignty and freedom. They want profit only. Therefore they do not care to learn how to control their private keys, but rather buy an ETF or another custodial solution. If more and more (traditional) institutions gain control over private keys they could pose a threat to bitcoin's consensus. Meaning: they will not support the fundamental philosophy of Bitcoin but the interests of themselves. That would not be Bitcoin anymore. Therefore learn how to hold your own keys and tell your peers to do so too.
