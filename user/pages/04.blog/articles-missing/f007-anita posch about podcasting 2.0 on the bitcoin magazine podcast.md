# Anita Posch about Podcasting 2.0 on the Bitcoin Magazine Podcast

This week on the “Bitcoin Magazine Podcast,” host Christian Keroles sat down with long-time Bitcoin podcaster and advocate Anita Posch. Posch is the host of the fantastic “Anita Posch Show” where she highlights the efforts of Bitcoiners around the globe, especially bitcoiners in Africa and LATAM. 

In this episode, Keroles and Posch focused on new podcasting technology being built on top of the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Podcasting started as the ultimate way for individuals to broadcast information without corporate influence. It was a medium for the people. Since it’s humble beginnings, podcasting has turned into a cultural phenomenon, but it has also become corrupted. Current podcasting infrastructure no longer supports the censorship-resistant dream of its origin. Bitcoin looks to be an answer here for creators to cultivate community and monetize directly with P2P cash. 

Listen in to this episode to learn more about Posch and the crossroads between Bitcoin and the future of podcasting.
