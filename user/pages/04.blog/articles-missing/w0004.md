# Weekly Nr. 4 - Buy the Dip

<h2>Thought of the Week by Anita Posch</h2>
In the last two weeks, the bitcoin price took off. I felt that this was going too fast. After almost reaching the ATH from December 2017,  bitcoin’s price plunged from 19,000 USD back to 16,500. Many people ask why that happened. There are many explanations. But in the end, it is always the same. If the price skyrockets in a short period of time, it will always fall back. Time to breathe again, educate yourself on Bitcoin, and buy the dip.
