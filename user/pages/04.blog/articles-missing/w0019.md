# Weekly Nr. 19 - The Bitcoin energy debate

<h2>Thought of the week by Anita Posch</h2>
<div class="white-box"><strong>The Bitcoin Energy Debate</strong>
It is really important to me to debunk false arguments about Bitcoin mining. I worry about the climate situation and nature too. At the age of 16, long before the internet came along, I started supporting Greenpeace and Amnesty International. Now you see, why I am doing all this mining related content and am highlighting the humanitarian aspects of Bitcoin. This week's <a href="https://bitcoinundco.com/en/sebastien-gouspillou/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast with Sébastien Gouspillou</a> is one of the most important work in that respect I did so far. I know not every Bitcoin miner has his awareness, but I believe that mining on renewables is the inevitable future. Next Thursday's guest is also incredible, it's Abe Cambridge of Sun Exchange. We are discussing the intersection of Bitcoin, solar-power, decentralization and its positive effects on humanity and nature. Stay tuned.</div>

<h2>Quote of the Week</h2>
<blockquote>"Since bitcoin responds to a major need and is there to last, it seems more relevant to take advantage of this new electrical demand than to be afraid with catastrophic studies or to wait for a miracle protocol supposed to replace the proven principle of proof of work." - Sébastien Gouspillou</blockquote>
