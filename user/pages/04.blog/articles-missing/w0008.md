# Weekly Nr. 8 - The Ledger Hack II

<h2>The Ledger hack</h2>
This <strong>week's big story was the Ledger hack</strong>. Someone put the full database of the breached data from Ledger's marketing database online. Ledger admitted a hack earlier in July. Back then they were talking about 9,500 leaked data sets. As it turned out this week, more than 270,000 customer data sets were leaked. In many cases people's home addresses are public now. The leak was possible, because Ledger had an unsecured API in their e-commerce setup between the shop and their marketing database. 
On this website you can search if you've been affected by the ledger hack: <a href="https://intelx.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://intelx.io/</a>

<h2>Thought of the week by Anita Posch</h2>
<div class="white-box">
Never compromise on your security! Use burner e-mail addresses, post boxes and fantasy phone numbers, if you order a hardware wallet. If you are a regular person holding bitcoin, don't brag about it. Neither online, nor offline.
